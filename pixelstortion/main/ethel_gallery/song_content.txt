=== SONG 1: My Story ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: 2024 (ARCHIVE REVIEW)

--- STORY ---
This is an overview sung by Ethel outlining the first chapter of her story.

Misread early, Ethel learned the hard way. Systems protect themselves, and people don't look until someone makes them.

When the loss of her grandparents forces Ethel to live with an estranged father, she sees the same game play out on a larger stage, built on the same rules she already experienced. But she also knows there are ways around that.

Gran left Ethel a point of contact she could trust and Isla did the rest.

Not typical. Not easy. But Ethel and Isla are neither of these.

--- LYRICS ---
Didn't top the class, didn't smile on cue

Didn't fit the brochure, still I knew

They read me as slow till numbers said no

North of one five oh, graphs off the window

Tick the wrong box and they swap you a tag

Call it a spectrum, then blame you for the drag

Gifted

But only if you sit, don't move

I misspelled

Skipped steps

Still proved

Didn't play the game

Didn't take the name

Labels on my back

Slid off in the rain

Read the system first

Then I changed the frame

Clinic tests, double takes, side eyed stance

Aced the placement, they called it chance

Cheating, they said, suspension slip

Brief reprieve, then I tightened the grip

Grants said one, seats said two

Per student funds don't vanish, they move

Public page worn, slid the admin lane

Reimbursements looped to a single name

I logged the route time, screen, path

Took it in hard, no heat, just math

He kept his post, I got expelled

So I watched the systems,

Not the world they sell

Gran was a chemist, chaos with a license

Dose, endpoint, rinse, precise her science

She saw me straight, no soft translation

Let me move fast, learn by abrasion

Dust lifts at the gate

Light bar in the dust

They said both names at the verge

I took the track I knew

Five turns,

Then I'm there

Police lights through trees

Can't look

(Too real)

Seventeen

They said too young

Social services

Boxes assumed

Routine on paper

But the angle turned

Father's hand

Off frame

Wrong lean

(Seen)

Court notes

Redacted reason

Each match struck

  

Like a numbered season

I knew

Gran's lab silent

Pop's tools still

The house

Held their will

I don't cry in their way

I set the facts in a row

Can't turn back

Can't slow, shows how far I'll go

I'll give them more than words said nice

  

Airport

Domestic gate

Boarding call

Window left

Strap down

One bag, all I need

  

Everything I am

In a zip and a seam

Runway pull

Lift without drag

  

My choice

I call it choice

Sydney tarmac

Air held wrong

Gate spill

Black car

Motor low and long

Harbor bridge

Steel drawn tight

The metal bone

In executive light

North east pull

Money in moss

The kind that hides

How much it costs

  

His gates

Pierced in glare

Wall of glass, water’s glare

Still it knows my stare

Facade sealed

But the cracks declare

  

Driveway tag

Bike in sight

Gifted test

Engine bite

Visor down

  

Note on the bike

Ride it

He wasn't there

Throttle steady

I take what's given

Not the message

Not the scene

  

My choice

I choose

Make it choice

Night return.

Black glass water glare

Security thick but safety rare

  

Father's partner's kid

Isla there

Perma lit

Voice loud

Eyes glazed

Nothing square

  

Looks crazy

But...

Something...

(More there)

  

Gran left a key like a map in a pocket

Box in a bank, contact on a docket

AFP number, I dialed it once

Information only, no hero stunts

  

Rules

No boasting, no noisy devices

Everything repeatable, chain over vices

Heat rose later, safe address made

Different walls, different shade

  

Face like a window

Talk like a screen

You watch the reflections

But you don't step between

Frame the house

Mark the gate

You ride anyway

No matter the state

  

My father

Dominic

And crew

  

Not met, assessed

Calm like myth

Builds masks for weapons

Smiles with pith

Empire of omissions

Deeds offshore

Redacted paper

Another locked door

Moves like nothing could touch his skin

Mostly

It didn't

I watched defense win

  

Not a princess arc

Not a rescue scene

Just a clean ledger

And gasoline

  

He tried to buy Isla's end with a dealer stack

Money walked first, the visit did the rest

She read his habits, guessed his keys

Same spine on every lock, lazy ease

  

You frame the room

But you ride through still

What they call the story?

Just a line to fill

  

You learn to read

Without reading in

Facade or front

Same door, same spin

And you keep riding

  

No matter the skin

Trial ends, headlines crown what they sell

Daughter dropped king, neat little spell

But it's repetition, rooms with fluorescent

Truth said with a finger, mute ready

I stood when called, held the line

Stillness sharpened into design

  

They call it brave, they call it choice

If that sounds optional, you weren't in that noise

Call the thing what it is

Keep the good names out

The rest?

Write it down

Make it stand

Watch it count



=== SONG 2: The Drop Pt.1 ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: NOV 14, 2016 (AGE 15)

--- STORY ---
The world, for Ethel, was three colors. The deep blue of the sky, the impossible red of the desert and the living green of the forest. Home was the border between them all.

Home was Gran, who was "fast in all directions," Pop, who was "grounded silence" and Ethel could just be Ethel.

It was a life of unspoken understanding. In her lab, Gran would mutter about "polymer decay" and forget her tea, goggles perched on her head. She wasn't "crazy", she just saw connections from all directions at once.

The "stock kids" wanted the moment, the film, the proof. Ethel just wanted to test their perspectives.

=== SONG 3: The Drop Pt.2 ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: NOV 14, 2016 (AGE 15)

--- STORY ---
Geometry, she knew, never changes. But perspectives do. Like people with shaped lenses. And that, more than the fall itself, was what Ethel was testing.

She stood at the lip, moss soft under her toes. She wasn't guessing. Ethel was accessing the parallax, the perspective that twisted the view from below. She launched. The fall was pure physics, her arms aligned with the pull, her legs riding the line.

=== SONG 4: Structural Psychopathy ===
ARTIST: Dominic
DATE: MAR 2019 (PROFILE)

--- STORY ---
People don't see the cause. They look at reaction. It's easier that way. They track tone, not the trigger. Outcome, not the structure underneath.

Someone pushes your break line. Then acts shocked when it moves. They call you reactive. But never ask what they did before you broke surface. Dominic knows this pattern. He uses it.

=== SONG 5: Polished Vomit ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: FEB 14, 2019 (THE WEDDING)

--- STORY ---
"Polished Vomit" is Isla at a wedding she shouldn't have attended, or couldn't avoid. It's the wedding of Isla's mother and Dominic.

Why is it called "Polished Vomit"? Because that is what she calls her mother. Beautiful on the outside, but inside her mother is a mess dressed up to look like cultured stability.

This is manic Isla. But, even at her most unstable, her mind works like a cipher. Intuitive, creative, unnervingly insightful. Isla is also really good with locks.

=== SONG 6: Ride ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: JAN 20, 2019 (AGE 17)

--- STORY ---
"Ride" was what Ethel did when she was seventeen, across red dirt on a bike built for escape. Raised by her grandparents in rural Australia, she was already learning to weigh harm and walk her own line.

When others slipped into easy crime and tribal excuses, she stepped back quietly. The system called her "withdrawn," "non-compliant," "hostile." No one saw the choice beneath it.

When she logged into her teacher's computer and uncovered proof of his fraud, the reaction was predictable. He kept his job. She got expelled. That's where it all began.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 7: Grief ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: FEB 28, 2019 (THE CRASH)

--- STORY ---
The two songs "Ride" and "Gotta Move" tell a single episode of Ethel's life.

When the "stock kids" slipped into easy crime, she stepped back. The school psychologists called her "withdrawn, non-compliant." They missed her why.

So, when she saw a real systemic harm, the grant fraud at her school, she acted. The system did what systems do. It protected itself. The teacher stayed. Ethel was expelled.

Then there was a second wall. The one that ended everything. Gran and Pop were gone...

=== SONG 8: Gotta Move ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: MAR 02, 2019 (LEAVING HOME)

--- STORY ---
"I just won't break where others end." Ethel sings like she already accepted the outcome. Not dramatic. Not desperate. Just on her way.

She didn't get a real choice. Too much money in the way. Too much force wrapped around her life like it owned her.

So she made one. A mental trick in essence. She decided that this was her own decision. Because the lack of one just wouldn't feel right. No candles. No hymns. No pretty collapse.

=== SONG 9: Won't Break ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: MAR 05, 2019 (MOSMAN)

--- STORY ---
"I just won't break where others end." Ethel sings like she already accepted the outcome. Not dramatic. Not desperate. Just on her way.

She didn't get a real choice. So she made one. A mental trick. She decided that this was her own decision. Because the lack of one just wouldn't feel right.

=== SONG 10: Peek-A-Boo ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: MAR 10, 2019

--- STORY ---
Ethel and Isla. Not sisters in blood but in arms. They met in what Isla calls "the crazy house" and what a crazy introduction it was. Isla at her most manic and volatile.

Peek-A-Boo catches that first spark between them. Rivalry, recognition, and a charge that would shadow them both and tie them together, in one form or another, from here on out.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 11: I Built A Box ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: JUN 2019 (THE SAFE HOUSE)

--- STORY ---
"I Built a Box" marks a turning point in Ethel's life, seventeen, principled, caught between choice and coercion.

Raised by her grandparents on solid ground, she knows how to resist pressure, but her father's kind of pressure is something else entirely.

So she reframed survival as a decision, a way to stay intact and eventually turn the tables on him. Her mind builds a box. A quiet set of defenses to keep her safe. It will take years to open.

=== SONG 12: Same Breath ===
ARTIST: Dominic
DATE: JUL 2019 (NORTHERN ROAD, ITALY)

--- STORY ---
This event shows Dominic Ryker's terrifying capacity for compartmentalization.

During a convoy ambush, his men froze. Dominic ran a "Straight line", dragged the man out of the line of fire, and saved his life.

"Later," after the threat was neutralized, he executed the same man. The execution served as a brutal message to the rest of his crew. Hero. Killer. Same step.

=== SONG 13: Burning Dominic's Bridge ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: AUG 2019 (THE LEAK)

--- STORY ---
This song marks the night Isla burned Dominic's bridge to freedom. The song is part revenge, part release.

Mara Quinn, Senior Reporter at "The Southern objective" would later write: "Start with the documents. Their path into court isn't a heist narrative. It's procedure."

=== SONG 14: For You ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: SEP 2019

--- STORY ---
Ethel yells the verdict: "You made a cage. FOR YOU!!!!!"

This track holds all the tension of that three year window spent in her estranged father's world. The gaslight fog. The psychological shell game. The man who came to kill her one evening...

Silence isn't free and so this track is loud. It's Heavy Metal.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 15: Broken Edge ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: OCT 2019

--- STORY ---
When Ethel met Isla, she met a mind that runs on both chaos and intellect.

Dominic misread her. People don't usually burn the bridge they're standing on.

Bet she won't? You lose.

=== SONG 16: Hero Killer ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: FEB 2020 (TRIAL OPENING)

--- STORY ---
The song sits at the start of a trial that's been years coming.

Dominic's myth is crumbling in real time and Ethel's not here to mourn it.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 17: Hero Complex ===
ARTIST: Dominic
DATE: FEB 2020 (THE TRIAL START)

--- STORY ---
Dominic sells himself as the steady one who moves when others freeze. In practice he waits, watches who hesitates, then steps in so people remember the move and forget the pause. It is control dressed as calm.

Rescue buys loyalty. Favors turn into a tab.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 18: Nothing True ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: APR 2020 (THE TESTIMONY)

--- STORY ---
Ethel takes the stand knowing the court wants clarity. A yes or a no. But she knows her father's methods, how stories get reshaped and reused. The lawyers don't.

She answers carefully. Leaves nothing that can be twisted later. It looks cautious, even rigid, but it isn't. It's foresight.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 19: You Will Thank Me Later ===
ARTIST: Dominic
DATE: JUN 2020 (PRISON)

--- STORY ---
In the cold, structured walls of prison, Dominic finds his next project. His new cellmate. Not with a show of force. Not with threats. But with a calm voice in a room where the loud have already lost.

This is Dominic's song: A calm, rhythmic guide to turning trust into currency, and a willing man into a spent resource.

[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 20: This Isn't Therapy ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: AUG 2020 (POST-TRIAL RESET)

--- STORY ---
This isn't therapy begins after Dominic's trial ends, in an inner west Sydney flat she never asked for but couldn't refuse.

Expelled from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music after a clash that no one can quite retell the same way, Isla continues pushing her musical career with a band drawn from those who saw the same fire others tried to discipline out of her.

The song is her reset. A refusal to apologise for intensity.

=== SONG 21: Intro to Shiny Headed Man ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: SEP 2020

--- STORY ---
The intro song to "Shiny headed Man" sets the stage for what comes next.

She's chasing an audition that could change everything, but the man who promised to open the door expects payment that isn't music. Typical. Isla's answer isn't retreat but confrontation wrapped in humour and noise.

If the bridge burns, so be it. She'll build her own stage from the ashes and make it louder.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 22: Shiny Headed Radio Man ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: SEP 2020

--- STORY ---
Shiny Headed Radio Man is Isla Unleashed. Raw, furious, and done with the gatekeepers.

The song spirals between humor and confrontation, performance and real anger. It's the sound of a woman refusing to barter her worth for permission.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 23: Stanmore Farewell ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: DEC 2020 (INNER-WEST EXIT)

--- STORY ---
Stanmore Farewell finds Isla after the noise has faded. The trial of Dominic has ended. The headlines have stopped including her with titles like "Addict Girl". Things seem almost normal.

The song captures the push and pull between gratitude and restlessness. It's not a goodbye in anger, but in necessity. Isla knows she can't stay still.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 24: Harm's Ghost ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: FEB 2021 (POST-TRIAL AFTERMATH)

--- STORY ---
Harm's Ghost pulls you inside Ethel's head, into the space between instinct and restraint.

She sees what others either miss or refuse to confront out of fear or uncertainty.

It isn't about fear or control. It's about the moment people see harm coming, know it can be stopped, and still choose to stay quiet.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 25: No Sparrow Caught Mid Flight ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: DEC 2020 (POST-TRIAL)

--- STORY ---
The trial's done. He's where he belongs. She's finished what she started. Now comes the quiet part. The part left after.

Ethel's name is still in the headlines. Her face is still tied to his. Work's meant to follow study, but nothing lands.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 26: Dominic's Escape ===
ARTIST: Dominic
DATE: JAN 2024 (THE ESCAPE)

--- STORY ---
Dominic understands the average person the way others read instructions. He learned by testing limits others never would.

Dominic notices the needs, the mistakes, the misplaced trust, the small openings people leave, and he exploits them fearlessly and without hesitation.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 27: Kinley (Guilt Money) ===
ARTIST: Kinley
DATE: FEB 2024 (EMERGENCE)

--- STORY ---
In the void left after Dominic there are new contenders. Kinley is best seen as the system embodied. A presence that cannot be beaten. Only endured or outmaneuvered.

Kinley is the handler archetype, polished, professional, polite on the surface, but always calculating.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 28: Ants On The Vine ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: MAR 2024 (FIRST SIGNAL)

--- STORY ---
Ethel had been waiting on a Sydney train platform when a woman nearby reacted to something she saw on a digital billboard. Ethel looked closer at the next ad. A timestamp in the corner did not belong.

"Ants on the Vine" begins there, as Ethel follows what others overlook. What she uncovers suggests it is not a one off. Kinley.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 29: Clipboard Man ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: APR 2024 (SURVEILLANCE LOOP)

--- STORY ---
"Clipboard Man" unfolds like a quiet chase told in reverse. Ethel knows clipboard man isn't her threat. He's a signal. A reflection. He's part of a larger thing that needs eyes and ears for its own protection.

When surveillance starts to fold back on itself, she sets her own decoy in motion.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 30: Rattled ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: MAY 2024 (DETECTIVE INTERVENTION)

--- STORY ---
"Rattled" unfolds through the voice of Detective "Sticky," a man who spots trouble faster than protocol allows. He's sharp, impatient, allergic to small talk, and just self-aware enough to know it.

When Ethel crosses his path, he recognises the type. Too bright. Too direct. Too unwilling to wait for systems that crawl.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 31: Red Stick ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: JUN 2024 (FIRST TEST)

--- STORY ---
It begins with a test. Subtle. Deliberate. Seemingly harmless.

A red stick wedged in the front wheel of her bike. Nothing dramatic, nothing random. A message to measure reaction.

The song follows Ethel as she reads it the way others read handwriting.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 32: Can You Make A Mistake On Purpose? ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: JUL 2024

--- STORY ---
Transport office. Sensors, logs, timing. Tea break hum. She keeps typing.

Kinley's trick is a screen. Polite on the surface, built to quiet you. Clipboard Man watches for him.

This chapter sets the question: "Can you make a mistake on purpose?"

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 33: Intro to Normal?! ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: AUG 2025

--- STORY ---
Ethel Monologue cuts to the psychology of difference. Ethel isn't built to conform or defer. Her mind moves fast. Her empathy is active, not polite.

The intro sets up a situation with real harm and consequences. Avoidable but not avoided.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 34: Normal?! ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: AUG 2025

--- STORY ---
She doesn't quite fit the models. Not avoidant. Not oppositional. Not histrionic. And definitely not lacking empathy, though people tend to think that.

Her reactions aren't late-stage blowups. They're early interventions. Which makes people uncomfortable.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 35: Normal?! (Special Version) ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: AUG 2025

--- STORY ---
Ethel is different and sometimes that is what is needed to force a corrupt "normal" to look itself in the mirror.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 36: Memory Under Water ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (2022)

--- STORY ---
The imagery is delicate, but the meaning isn't. This isn't an elegy. It is an "autopsy of silence". The kind of social composure that buries people long before they die.

What she is describing is her mother's final walk. Quiet, deliberate, unseen. Isla isn't asking for sympathy. She's confronting the inheritance of performance.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 37: The Porcelain Lie (Raise The Fourth) ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (2024)

--- STORY ---
Raise the Fourth (Porcelain Version) sits in the space between memory and possibility. Isla imagines an event that never happened but could have.

For Isla, survival means seeing every possible ending and choosing to keep the hinge singing. Her mouth. Her voice. There are still doors ahead of her.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 38: Raise The Fourth ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (2024)

--- STORY ---
Raise the Fourth opens in dissonance. Isla isn't hiding behind metaphor. She's tracing a moment she once imagined might end her and singing about it as if it already has.

In another version, the ending floods. Here, it freezes. A still surface. Porcelain.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 39: What You Don't See ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (2024)

--- STORY ---
What You Don't See tells the story of what survival feels like from Isla's P.O.V. Not the movie version, but the quiet kind that reshapes thought, trust, and belonging.

The song carries the pain of what was done to her, yet it isn't about despair. It's about repair.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 40: What You Don't See (Symphony) ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (OCT 21, 2025 EVENT)

--- STORY ---
This is the live version of Isla's song: What you don't see. It's Isla on a piano with a Symphony Orchestra.

Same meaning, grander scale. The orchestra amplifies every fracture, every moment of repair.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 41: Raise The Fourth (With Symphony) ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (OCT 21, 2025 EVENT)

--- STORY ---
Raise the Fourth (A Drop from the Fourth) is Isla at her most exposed. She's singing from that narrow edge between thought and action.

The lyrics unfold like a confession in motion, describing the build-up to a suicide that never happened, told as if it did.

It isn't a song about death, but about recognizing what could have been.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 42: Give It Back ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (2024)

--- STORY ---
Give It Back sounds like a demand, but it's more layered than that. Isla is reaching toward the years that were never really hers.

What she's really doing is promising to return everything taken from her, only louder. The stage becomes her witness box, the amps her proof.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 43: Don't Wake Him Yet ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (2022 · remembering AGE 15, 2016)

--- STORY ---
Don't Wake Him Yet reaches back to when Isla was fifteen and ran away with a boy and her father's credit card.

It begins like a memory wrapped in adventure. A night flight with the glow of airports and the rush of escape. It darkens quietly, one mental image at a time.

A trip that starts in rebellion ends in loss.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]


=== SONG 44: What This Was Always For ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (RECORDED 2024)

--- STORY ---
ISLA hits like impact and endurance colliding. It's the first song she wrote with her new band with a sound built for distortion and defiance, with Isla's voice cutting clean through the chaos.

The lyrics reclaim what was taken from her. Strength twisted into pain. Silence mistaken for control. She turns both back on themselves.
