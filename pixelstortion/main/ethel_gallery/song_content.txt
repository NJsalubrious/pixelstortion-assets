=== SONG 1: My Story ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: 2024 (ARCHIVE REVIEW)

--- STORY ---
This is an overview sung by Ethel outlining the first chapter of her story.

Misread early, Ethel learned the hard way. Systems protect themselves, and people don't look until someone makes them.

When the loss of her grandparents forces Ethel to live with an estranged father, she sees the same game play out on a larger stage, built on the same rules she already experienced. But she also knows there are ways around that.

Gran left Ethel a point of contact she could trust and Isla did the rest.

Not typical. Not easy. But Ethel and Isla are neither of these.

--- LYRICS ---
Didn't top the class, didn't smile on cue

Didn't fit the brochure, still I knew

They read me as slow till numbers said no

North of one five oh, graphs off the window

Tick the wrong box and they swap you a tag

Call it a spectrum, then blame you for the drag

Gifted

But only if you sit, don't move

I misspelled

Skipped steps

Still proved

Didn't play the game

Didn't take the name

Labels on my back

Slid off in the rain

Read the system first

Then I changed the frame

Clinic tests, double takes, side eyed stance

Aced the placement, they called it chance

Cheating, they said, suspension slip

Brief reprieve, then I tightened the grip

Grants said one, seats said two

Per student funds don't vanish, they move

Public page worn, slid the admin lane

Reimbursements looped to a single name

I logged the route time, screen, path

Took it in hard, no heat, just math

He kept his post, I got expelled

So I watched the systems,

Not the world they sell

Gran was a chemist, chaos with a license

Dose, endpoint, rinse, precise her science

She saw me straight, no soft translation

Let me move fast, learn by abrasion

Dust lifts at the gate

Light bar in the dust

They said both names at the verge

I took the track I knew

Five turns,

Then I'm there

Police lights through trees

Can't look

(Too real)

Seventeen

They said too young

Social services

Boxes assumed

Routine on paper

But the angle turned

Father's hand

Off frame

Wrong lean

(Seen)

Court notes

Redacted reason

Each match struck

  

Like a numbered season

I knew

Gran's lab silent

Pop's tools still

The house

Held their will

I don't cry in their way

I set the facts in a row

Can't turn back

Can't slow, shows how far I'll go

I'll give them more than words said nice

  

Airport

Domestic gate

Boarding call

Window left

Strap down

One bag, all I need

  

Everything I am

In a zip and a seam

Runway pull

Lift without drag

  

My choice

I call it choice

Sydney tarmac

Air held wrong

Gate spill

Black car

Motor low and long

Harbor bridge

Steel drawn tight

The metal bone

In executive light

North east pull

Money in moss

The kind that hides

How much it costs

  

His gates

Pierced in glare

Wall of glass, water’s glare

Still it knows my stare

Facade sealed

But the cracks declare

  

Driveway tag

Bike in sight

Gifted test

Engine bite

Visor down

  

Note on the bike

Ride it

He wasn't there

Throttle steady

I take what's given

Not the message

Not the scene

  

My choice

I choose

Make it choice

Night return.

Black glass water glare

Security thick but safety rare

  

Father's partner's kid

Isla there

Perma lit

Voice loud

Eyes glazed

Nothing square

  

Looks crazy

But...

Something...

(More there)

  

Gran left a key like a map in a pocket

Box in a bank, contact on a docket

AFP number, I dialed it once

Information only, no hero stunts

  

Rules

No boasting, no noisy devices

Everything repeatable, chain over vices

Heat rose later, safe address made

Different walls, different shade

  

Face like a window

Talk like a screen

You watch the reflections

But you don't step between

Frame the house

Mark the gate

You ride anyway

No matter the state

  

My father

Dominic

And crew

  

Not met, assessed

Calm like myth

Builds masks for weapons

Smiles with pith

Empire of omissions

Deeds offshore

Redacted paper

Another locked door

Moves like nothing could touch his skin

Mostly

It didn't

I watched defense win

  

Not a princess arc

Not a rescue scene

Just a clean ledger

And gasoline

  

He tried to buy Isla's end with a dealer stack

Money walked first, the visit did the rest

She read his habits, guessed his keys

Same spine on every lock, lazy ease

  

You frame the room

But you ride through still

What they call the story?

Just a line to fill

  

You learn to read

Without reading in

Facade or front

Same door, same spin

And you keep riding

  

No matter the skin

Trial ends, headlines crown what they sell

Daughter dropped king, neat little spell

But it's repetition, rooms with fluorescent

Truth said with a finger, mute ready

I stood when called, held the line

Stillness sharpened into design

  

They call it brave, they call it choice

If that sounds optional, you weren't in that noise

Call the thing what it is

Keep the good names out

The rest?

Write it down

Make it stand

Watch it count



=== SONG 2: The Drop Pt.1 ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: NOV 14, 2016 (AGE 15)

--- STORY ---
The world, for Ethel, was three colors. The deep blue of the sky, the impossible red of the desert and the living green of the forest. Home was the border between them all. Home was Gran, who was "fast in all directions," Pop, who was "grounded silence" and Ethel could just be Ethel.  
  
It was a life of unspoken understanding. A "thanks" was never needed for a new bike chain, just as an "I love you" was never needed to feel the "unspoken alliance of minds" she shared with Gran. They just knew .  
  
In her lab, Gran would mutter about "polymer decay" and forget her tea, goggles perched on her head. She wasn't "crazy", she just saw connections from all directions at once. And in that "fast" way of seeing, she saw Ethel perfectly.  
  
Ethel rode the fence line, just because. She wasn't like the "stock kids" with their "big boots, big bikes, bigger land." She wasn't interested in riding gates or fences . She was interested in the "weird pixel on satellite" that shouldn't have been there. The "bend in the earth" she found herself.  
  
It wasn't a cliff, not exactly. It was a twenty meter drop into a basin wrapped in green, a place where one wrong step would mean not landing straight, or at least that is how it looked.  
  
The "stock kids" wanted the moment, the film, the proof. Ethel just wanted to test their perspectives.

--- LYRICS ---
Where the desert meets the forest

Red

Blue

Home

  

Gran left the gate open

She always does

Bike's warm

Pop moved it

Didn't say anything

  

Tyre's rotated

Chain cleaned

I didn't do it

  

No need to say thanks

They know

I know

  

Gran will be in her lab by now

Window open

Goggles on her head

Talking to herself

About polymer decay

And forgetting her tea again

She's not crazy

Just fast in all directions

I ride the fence line straight

They're ahead

Three of them

Stock kids

Big boots Big bikes

Bigger land

  

They ride gates and fences

I ride

Just because

Fifteen K out

Five K in

No tracks marked

Just a weird pixel on satellite

where there shouldn't have been

  

Didn't even look like a fall

But it was

Canopy snaps shut

Track tightens

Ferns stretch over the trail

Air shifts  heavy now

  

One more turn

And we'll see it

I found it last year

Kept it to myself for a while

  

It's not a cliff 

not exactly

It's a bend in the earth

where the stone curves out

drops twenty meters

into a basin wrapped in green

  

Water falls like glass

If the light's right

One wrong step

And you won't land straight

  

But if you do

They're filming

They want the dive

They want the moment

  

I don't say where from

I just stop!

They know what that means

Here we go!



=== SONG 3: The Drop Pt.2 ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: NOV 14, 2016 (AGE 15)

--- STORY ---
Geometry, she knew, never changes. But perspectives do. Like people with shaped lenses. And that, more than the fall itself, was what Ethel was testing.  
  
She stood at the lip, moss soft under her toes. She wasn't guessing. Ethel was accessing the parallax, the perspective that twisted the view from below. She saw the "direct line" they couldn't.  
  
She launched.  
  
The fall was pure physics, her arms aligned with the pull, her legs riding the line. The basin tilted up to meet her. The impact was a forceful clap that echoed of the falls rocks, then turquoise silence as Ethel watched a crayfish tail flick through the caustic blue. She rose. Surface break. New breath.  
  
Back on the stone, she passed behind them. They were still on the shelf, staring at their screens, but their posture had changed. The easy bravado was gone, replaced by a "gait shifted," heavy unease.  
  
This was the real test of perspective. They had the image of the dive, but now they were colliding with the reality of the person who did it.

--- LYRICS ---
Looks are deceiving

From here?

Direct line

Deep water

Unlikely to miss

  

I won't

  

From down there?

Parallax

Perspective

Edges jagged

Dive looks impossible

Basin formed from cliffs

Green canopy desert dust drift

  

They've taken the shelf

spread out facing the drop

Phones up

Light glints glass set to catch the distance

  

Moss soft under my toes

Heel just off the lip

Hip turned in

Here we go

  

Launch

  

Fall

  

Air takes over

Arms align with the drop's pull

Legs ride the fall's line

The basin tilts up

  

Impact

water wraps shut

Pressure locks the ribs

Light caustics scatter turquoise

  

Bottom clear enough to see

A tail fly past

Eggs tucked under

crays tail-flicks fast

  

Slow turn

Kick

Rise

  

Surface break

New breath

  

My spot

That lone pixel dot

Found from above

The Drop

  

They're still on the shelf

Phones steady

Walking apart heavy

Gait shifted

  

One looks stops lets it go

Another stays fixed on the screen

Eyes rise short laugh

Cuts it

  

Stone underfoot again

I pass behind

From their shelf no line through

Rock teeth in the drop

Depth squeezes distance

  

It shouldn't work

They'll post it

No bearings

No measure

Just noise

I won't correct them



=== SONG 4: Structural Psychopathy ===
ARTIST: Dominic
DATE: MAR 2019 (PROFILE)

--- STORY ---
This track dissects how harm is engineered without ever raising a voice.
Not rage. Not impulse. Design.

Dominic doesn’t attack people — he reframes them. He shifts attention from cause to reaction, from trigger to tone, until responsibility quietly relocates. The song follows that logic through planning rooms, deadlines, “practical” compromises, and polite conversations where exhaustion becomes leverage and consent is manufactured.

What sounds like reason is pressure.
What looks like calm is control.
And when the structure finally fails, the narrative is already written — with someone else’s name on it.

This isn’t a song about anger.
It’s about how power works when it never needs to shout.

--- LYRICS ---
[Paste lyrics here]
People don't see the cause
They look at reaction
It's easier that way

They track tone
Not the trigger
Outcome
Not the structure underneath

Someone pushes your break line
Then acts shocked when it moves

They call you reactive
But never ask what they did
Before you broke surface

I have seen it everywhere
In every planning room in this city

Someone wants a shortcut
And someone else wants a scapegoat

And I feel it
I feel it happening to you

You were too tired
Exactly where they wanted you

See how they spun it
One outburst
And your history
Becomes the headline

That planner did not want clarity
He wanted control of the narrative
And he got it

Too exhausted
To defend the frame
They built around you

Let me show you the real pattern

They rewrite you when they can't read you
They flag your tone not the contact
They spin your story into their version
Then step back
I watched it land
I tracked it through
I don't let it go
Because intent cuts true

So let's sit
Let's talk

Your hands are trembling
Your emails stack unread
The ceiling of this project
You are holding it alone

And they think you are having a moment
Of course they do
Here you are at midnight
Fixing their mistake

With the soil report contradicting itself
For the third time

I see you arguing
For safer footings
But getting drowned out
By cost consultants
Who have never had sign off
On anything more than an agreement

Let's be practical
One rod is ideal
Rigor is ideal

But the schedule is bleeding out

And rigor does not help
When the bank will not extend the loan
And the panel meets in eight days

When the builder walks out

Projects this size
Live by adjustments
Not ideals

Two rods
Offset the load
Same result
Faster install
Cheaper labour

Eighteen to twenty four months
Back in your pocket

Your life back in your pocket

You can go home
You can sleep

Just say yes
Or don't say anything at all

If you want it to be
It can be

They rewrite you when they can't read you
They flag your tone not the contact
They turn your story into their version
Then step back
I watched it land
I tracked it through
I won't not let it slide
Because intent cuts true

It is over engineered
It is structurally sound
You know it is

You're' exhausted

Let the project breathe
Let yourself breathe

You can go home
You can turn off your phone
Spend time with your kids
Spend time with your wife

That sounds good does it not
Yeah

I'll rewrite your story when they can't read you
I'll set your tone so they will not believe you
I'll shape truths story into my version
Then step back
I'll watched it land
I'll tracked it through
I'll let you be
What I needed you to be

Sydney
Late afternoon
The steel let go

Like a small earthquake
One
Two
Then another
The fourth floor hit the third
The third hit the second
The second hit the floor

The headline is written
Looking at you

It was just you
Just you
Just you
Just you

Just you

=== SONG 5: Polished Vomit ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: FEB 14, 2019 (THE WEDDING)

--- STORY ---
But the world was not all red dirt and clear water.  
  
At the exact same time Ethel was testing perspectives in the outback, a different world was cementing itself in Sydney. This was a world of glass and "calm insanity".  
  
This was Dominic's world.  
  
“Polished Vomit” is Isla at a wedding she shouldn’t have attended, or couldn’t avoid. It's the wedding of Isla's mother and Dominic.  
  
Why is it called "Polished Vomit"? Because that is what she calls her mother. Beautiful on the outside, but inside her mother is a mess dressed up to look like cultured stability.  
  
This is manic Isla. But, even at her most unstable, her mind works like a cipher. Intuitive, creative, unnervingly insightful.  
  
Isla is also really good with locks. Like magician level good but in the real world and not just with physical locks. Passwords as well.  

--- LYRICS ---
Dominic reads his kind.

Not me.

Mum’s his mirror.

Napkin smile.

Polished vomit.

  

I shine mine too.

Polished vomit.

Vomit polished.

Table placements.

Wine pours.

My ink covered.

Back row with the grey hairs.

  

Eat neat.

Or it ends on your lap.

Mask the meat!

  

Wedding cake wheeled out.

USB slipped in his shoe.

One guard blinked , 

Enough.

  

Cookies cracked.

Inside ,  passwords.

Not random.

Yours.

Your partner’s.

Hidden accounts.

  

Cheating’s easy to hack.

Easy to taste.

Sweet at first bite.

Bitter when it’s read aloud.

  

Projector wars.

Photos flash.

Same boat.

Same men.

Then a politician pants down.

Same deck.

  

Not my problem.

Maybe your wife’s.

  

Someone lunges.

I scream first.

Felt right.

  

His mask sweats.

Room stares.

I eat my cookie slow.

  

Rehab after.

DBT rooms.

He sent me there.

See Mum at least had guilt.

  

He still wants the vomit polished.

Errr.

Vomit blaaaa.



=== SONG 6: Ride ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: JAN 20, 2019 (AGE 17)

--- STORY ---
"Ride" was what Ethel did when she was seventeen, across red dirt on a bike built for escape.  
Raised by her grandparents in rural Australia, she was already learning to weigh harm and walk her own line.  
  
When others slipped into easy crime and tribal excuses, she stepped back quietly. The system called her “withdrawn,” “non-compliant,” “hostile.” No one saw the choice beneath it, the invisible line she refused to cross.  
  
When she logged into her teacher’s computer and uncovered proof of his fraud, the reaction was predictable. He kept his job. She got expelled.  
  
That’s where it all began.

--- LYRICS ---
Pulled the visor down on a sky like tin

Didn't check the map

Didn't ask the question

I know the trail that cuts behind the noise

  

They were laughing in the gravel lot

Boots too loose all smirk and spit

Someone tossed a stolen tin 

I stepped aside That wasn't it

I don't need their brand of bold

Doesn't mean I leave it cold

I just see the mirror behind the stunt

And who cops the hit when the fun runs blunt

  

I watch for the part that gets left out

The wallet that doesn't make it home

The kid that wakes up blamed

And they say it's just a joke

  

Just a laugh

Just one of those things

I call that a pattern

But I don't name it twice

  

I ride the edge but I don't drift blind

The hill tells me when to lean

My brain skips steps you never knew were there

Not guessing Just already seen

You think I'm wild 'cause I don't explain

  

That's fine

I've got gears for that

  

They thought I guessed the answer once

Didn't see the five steps in between

I read the frame before it sets 

And still get marked for broken screens

I opened a file with the wrong name once

Lit up a lie in quiet code

They told me "danger" I said "look closer"

Then they called it luck

Or something owed

  

Gran said

"You don't need to explain what you know

Just know it better than they can fake it"

Pop fixed tools he didn't own

Said

"Things still break Fix them anyway"

  

The ride back yelled with silence 

The trail too straight

The air too slow

Blue lights

No echo from the house

Just shapes

Just boots

Their mouths were moving

But all I heard

Was my name

Mispronounced

  

I don't run fast I run true

The path moves when I need it to

You think I'm chaos

I think you don't listen

I track the cost by what's missing

And what never makes it home

  

I never took the shortcut

I just knew where the road was hiding



=== SONG 7: Grief ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: FEB 28, 2019 (THE CRASH)

--- STORY ---
This song captures grief without ceremony.

There are no rituals here, no borrowed language, no public shape for loss. Grief arrives as interruption — meals half-set, distances unremembered, a key where it shouldn’t be. Ethel doesn’t process loss by collapsing into it; she moves through the absence, tracing what remains functional.

The song follows that motion: a bike ride without memory, a vault that smells wrong, documents that say more by what they omit, and a single phone number left behind like a delayed instruction. Grief doesn’t stop her. It sharpens her attention. Every missing line becomes evidence. Every pause reveals structure.

This is not a song about mourning as performance.  
It’s about grief as directive. The moment when  shock becomes clarity, and survival turns into intent.


--- LYRICS ---
Didn’t answer when they told me,
My tongue just stuck against my teeth.
Walked past cups and half-set tables,
Like the day hadn’t heard the grief.
Later I was near the shed or garage,
That whole stretch plays back blurred.
Small steel key where it shouldn’t be,
And I knew without a word.
 
Don’t light a candle, don’t play that hymn.
Don’t speak in lines they wrote for them.
I know the point my life dropped through,
I just won’t break where others do.
 
Took the bike out, don’t recall distance,
Just heat and strips of road.
Bank vault room smelled cold and empty,
Metal tray slid out, too loaded.
Unmarked pages, names Gran tracked,
Dates that never reached the news.
AFP number on one corner,
Clear as if she’d drawn a fuse.
Called from the curb with my hands shaking,
Engine ticking down beside.
Older voice picked up, said my first name,
Then said Gran’s like someone died.
Read out lines the way they were written,
He went quiet on one, then, “Go on.”
Asked if anyone knew I was calling,
Said, “Stay in sight. Don’t stay alone.”
 
Don’t light a candle, don’t stage the scene.
Don’t write me soft in the in-between.
I’m not the tears they wish they saw,
I’m not the myth they mourned me for.
 
If I look still, it’s bracing, not calm.
If I look gone, I’m running the facts.
Every gap, each missing line,
Showed the shape of what attacked.
 
I didn’t sort out labs or land,
Let the papers go to those who knew.
One backpack took the keys and records,
Left the rest for a later view.
They talked “placement” and “next of kin,”
Like I wasn’t part of what they planned.
By then I’d already marked my contact,
One number sitting in my hand.
I don’t wear grief like a costume piece,
It cuts, but I still move through.
When it hits and everything tilts sideways,
I use that jolt to see what’s true.



=== SONG 8: Gotta Move ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: MAR 02, 2019 (LEAVING HOME)

--- STORY ---
This song marks the moment Ethel realises she is no longer negotiating with people — she’s being routed by systems.

Social services speak in finished sentences: arrangements, placement, under eighteen. No questions. No curiosity. Just files with staples missing and decisions already made elsewhere. What should be protection feels procedural, polished, and wrong.

Ethel doesn’t panic or plead. She notices what isn’t said. She counts exits. She feels the weight behind the room — not visible, not loud, but coordinated. Control doesn’t arrive as force; it arrives with tea, a smile, and language that pretends nothing unusual is happening.

The song captures the shift from grief into vigilance. From loss into pattern recognition. Ethel understands she can’t simply run — not without leaving more questions unanswered. So she adjusts. She tracks angles before they shine. She lets them believe the transfer worked.

This is the first clear warning:
the silence isn’t absence.
It’s intent.

--- LYRICS ---
The silence is the warning

They said,

We've made arrangements.

I said,

You didn't ask.

They said

You're under eighteen.

I felt the room sink.

With loaded dice.

Gran's key's still in my palm.

Bent at the teeth.

They didn't ask how it happened.

Didn't ask what I saw in the glass.

The social worker said my name like a question.

I didn't answer.

Just looked at the file

with the staples missing.


Don't need to yell.

Just count the exits.

I know how many hands

Are behind this.


You don't place me.

You pass me.

I let you smile

Because you don't see it.

Too clean.


Found a name in the court logs.

Redacted

Sure.

But there's shape in omission.

Weight in silence.

No date.

No detail.

But a pattern built itself in the gaps.

One woman said,

This doesn't feel right.

She's gone.


Not scared.

Not small.

Just…

Aware.


Control isn't always loud.

Sometimes

It wears a suit

And hands you tea.


I don't run.

I adjust.

I track the angle of the knife

Before it shines.

You didn't plan for that.


You don't place me.

You pass me.

I let you smile

Because you don't see it.

Too clean.


I don't run.

I adjust.

I track the angle of the knife

before it shines.

You didn't plan for that.


You don't place me.

You pass me.

I let you smile

Because you don't see it.

Too clean.


=== SONG 9: Won't Break ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: MAR 05, 2019 (MOSMAN)

--- STORY ---
'I just won’t break where others end.'  
  
Ethel sings like she already accepted the outcome.  
Not dramatic. Not desperate.  
Just on her way.  
  
She didn’t get a real choice.  
Too much money in the way.  
Too much force wrapped around her life like it owned her.  
  
So she made one. A mental trick in essence.  
She decided that this was her own decision.  
Because the lack of one just wouldn’t feel right.  
  
No candles.  
No hymns.  
No pretty collapse.

--- LYRICS ---
Didn't cry when they told me

Just kicked the stand down slow

Police at the gate boots on gravel

They didn't know what I now know

Gran said life don't wait for clean hands

Pop said fix it if it squeaks

So I stripped my brakes that morning

Found her code in the teeth beneath


Don't light a candle don't play that hymn

Don't speak in lines they wrote for them

I know the way I know the bend

I just won't break where others end


Red drops back Blue takes hold

Cabin hums with edges bold

I said stop  but meant I can't

Too deep in to shift or plant

Exit signs I don't believe

I Know too much

Not enough for me

Could name the truth

Could change the scene

But can't block out what runs unseen

A fight I feel but can't defend

Not with three turns past pretend

No road back I'd trust to try

Not if my X can solve the Y


Don't light a candle Don't frame my face

Don't say I drifted out of place

I'm not the tears they try to fake

I'm what they build when something breaks


He talks

I track the tone

Eyes flick side

I scan alone

Rear view

Same car same space

Not slow

Not close

Just… placed

Could be a tail

But the driver's fine

One of his

Feels by design

We turn

The house arrives too soon

Like it leaned out to read the room

Windows set

Sharp Reflective

Gate peels back like something elective

Helmet

Bike

Too smooth

Too known

That's a gift

That's a loan

Still  I lift it

Still  I ride

Not for noise

But I came to try

Might not win

But I won't hide


Don't light a candle

Don't name regret

Don't say I

Failed what I hadn't met

If I move close if I play right

It's not surrender

It's just the night

  
The city's lit like fevered skin

A pulse that breaks draws back again

Headlights slice in broken time

Reflecting truths I can't align

Each street a question half unsaid

A choice not mine

A path misread

Windows flicker

Counting slow

What secrets keep

What shadows know

Chrome steals fragments

Gran's soft laugh

Pop's silence mapped across the path

Sky pulled thin

A stretched disguise

Like tension held behind its eyes

My grip tightens

Throttle breathes

Red turns green; the engine seethes

Traffic signals mark the gaps

In all the truths that slipped the traps

The city hushes

Holds its breath

Pavement hums like whispered death

I don't slow

I don't explain

This is decision

Because the lack of one

Just wouldn't feel right


=== SONG 10: Peek-A-Boo ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: MAR 10, 2019

--- STORY ---
Ethel and Isla. Not sisters in blood but in arms.  
  
They met in what Isla calls “the crazy house" and what a crazy introduction it was. Isla at her most manic and volatile. She could go from zero to a hundred and back again in a flash. She sounds unhinged. Survival mode brought to the edge.  
  
In this moment Ethel and Isla look like two opposites circling the same insane world of Dominic Ryker (Ethels Father). It starts as a taunt and ends like a mirror. One reads as chaos, the other as control, neither certain which role belongs to whom.  
  
Isla is a complex character and there is much more beneath the surface. Much more than her defenses and mental heath struggles initial convey.  
  
Peek-A-Boo catches that first spark between them. Rivalry, recognition, and a charge that would shadow them both and tie them together, in one form or another, from here on out.  
--- LYRICS ---
Peek-a-boo, inbox crack.

Socials open, almost mine.

But she notes me fast.

Mirror trace.

Door knock.

  

Jagged laugh.

New girl in the crazy house.

His blood.

The daughter.

  

Me, step-trash.

Not his mess.

What’s her score?

  

Big bike.

Gifted trap.

Let me split her.

  

At my door.

Time to shine.

  

Hey you, let’s drink.

She doesn’t.

Red hair, flat stare.

Direct, sharp.

  

Let’s fight.

Not fists.

Splinter ride.

  

My dream?

Her on the bike.

Me steering.

But she drives.

Always her hands.

CBD, ten at night.

North Sydney lights.

  

I don’t like this.

Not at all.

  

Intersection red.

Key yanked.

Pocketed.

I’m off.

  

Side street.

Stairs down, fast.

She’ll think train.

Up the other side, 

  

She’s there.

Waiting.

Bumps me.

Wallet gone.

Phone gone.

  

Thief!

She stole my shit!

Bar crowd stirs.

Nightlife trips her.

She falls hard.

Doesn’t rise.

Sirens coming.

Then she stands.

I stand.

We just stand.

I spit it:

She’s my sister.

She calls me crazy.

I look it.

  

She’s kinda cool.

xxxx her.


=== SONG 11: I Built A Box ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: JUN 2019 (THE SAFE HOUSE)

--- STORY ---
"I Built a Box" marks a turning point in Ethel's life, seventeen, principled, caught between choice and coercion.

Raised by her grandparents on solid ground, she knows how to resist pressure, but her father's kind of pressure is something else entirely.

So she reframed survival as a decision, a way to stay intact and eventually turn the tables on him. Her mind builds a box. A quiet set of defenses to keep her safe. It will take years to open.

--- LYRICS ---
He said

Just until you're steady

And it felt like sense

Because I wanted it to

They gave me a room with no dust

An ocean that doesn't move

A kitchen with nothing burned

And knives so beautiful

You forget they're sharp

She laughs like glass breaking in reverse

Says things that float but never land

I let it pass

She's not the test

  

He tells me things with just a look

How hard it's been How much he's done

For Isla For Us For me

The house nods in agreement

Like it's heard the story before

I wanted to believe it for a minute

To pretend I was trading one thing

For something real

To pretend I was sharp enough to catch the line

Before I crossed it

  

I signed the form

I used my card

I pinned it

He said it was sorted

Bail's expensive

Isla needed help

The link said refund

The account said

Mine always had

You'd do the same

Wouldn't you?

Wouldn't you?

  

It was one night

Just food

Just a deal

Just a moment

But a man came looking

Not loud Not rushed

He smiled

Like a receipt

And then

He was gone

Like someone

Pressed delete

  

No cops No claims

Just silence

Where a person had stood

And me

Watching my own hands

As if they'd done it

Knowing they hadn't

But knowing

He knew

I'd think they had

  

I built the box

And walked right in

Dressed it with justifications

Hung my guilt

Where the mirror should've been

It smelled like home

So I let it stand

Buying time

But I see my mind a little blind now

  

I built the box

And walked right in

Dressed it with justifications

Hung my guilt

Where the mirror should've been

  

It smelled like home

So I let it stand

Buying time

But I see my mind a little blind now


=== SONG 12: Same Breath ===
ARTIST: Dominic
DATE: JUL 2019 (NORTHERN ROAD, ITALY)

--- STORY ---
This event shows Dominic Ryker's terrifying capacity for compartmentalization.  
  
While maintaining a carefully fashioned facade in Sydney as a successful developer and philanthropist, Dominic is simultaneously running a global, violent empire. This song, "Same Breath", details an incident that occurred on the "Northern road" in Italy. We aren't told the underlying details.  
  
Here is what we know.  
  
During a convoy ambush, his men froze. Dominic, in an act of apparent heroism, ran a "Straight line", dragged the man out of the line of fire, and saved his life.  
  
"Later," after the threat was neutralized, he executed the same man. The execution served as a brutal message to the rest of his crew.  
  
Don't freeze. Don't stop. If you do you'll end up like this man.  
  
The song highlights the chilling reality witnessed by his henchman. This was a "Hero. Killer. Same step".

--- LYRICS ---
Northern road.

Stone walls.

Convoy steady.

  

Driver’s head burst.

Sound came late.

Echo rolled in slow.

  

Dominic slid him down.

Hands on the wheel.

No pause.

Just drove.

  

He drove.

He never stopped.

He drove.

He never stopped.

  

Trucks ripped.

Steel torn out.

Men erased in seconds.

  

One crawling near the trees.

Ground naked.

No cover.

Dominic ran.

Straight line.

Grabbed him by the belt.

Dragged him in.

No one else moved.

  

Same breath.

Same man.

One pulled back.

One never came.

  

He slipped to the tree line.

Silent.

Minutes stretched like years.

  

Then ground tore open.

Truck lifted.

Another flipped.

Burning.

  

Dominic walked back.

Step by step.

Checked each wreck.

Cleared them all.

  

Same breath!

Same man!

Dragged alive!

Cut down!

  

Later. Smoke gone.

Police paid.

Ground quiet.

  

He spoke low

to the man he saved.

Then he dropped.

Casual.

Gone.

  

Dominic walked past.

Didn’t look back.

  

Still warm.

Eyes wide.

Thought the talk was still on.

  

Same breath! SAME BREATH!

Same man! SAME MAN!

One dragged alive! DRAGGED ALIVE!

One cut down! CUT DOWN!

  

I was there.

I saw both.

Hero.

  

Killer.

Same step.


=== SONG 13: Burning Dominic's Bridge ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: AUG 2019 (THE LEAK)

--- STORY ---
This song marks the night Isla burned Dominc's bridge to freedom. The song is part revenge, part release.  
  
Mara Quinn, Senior Reporter at "The Southern objective" would later write:  
  
"Start with the documents. Their path into court isn’t a heist narrative. It’s procedure.  
  
Sources close to the matter say Isla, derided as “the addict girl” by commentators who haven’t read a brief, first surfaced material that pointed to long running patterns,  
  
Circular payments through shell entities, land assemblies that moved like chess, and external contractors whose invoices tracked neatly with campaign seasons. None of that becomes evidence until law enforcement recreates the trail. That’s what happened. Officers did the slow part. Warrants, images of drives, chain of custody. The songs and the spectacle are a sideshow. The documents are not."  
  
Mara Quinn, The Southern objective  
Article: Negative Space. What The Early Spin on Ryker Doesn’t Say

--- LYRICS ---
He bought me out in needles.

Found my dealer, stacked it high.

Last good time’s on me.

Like it made him noble.

Like my death was proof he cared.

I said thank you.

Like it was dinner.

Like he’d done me a favor.

Five men, front steps, watching glass.

I smiled through it ,  calm, steady.

Then slammed the teeth of the house back shut.

Steel psychos flip.

Shadows left in the dark.

You’ll be alright out there.

Wait a while.

He’ll be back.

No he won’t!

Fists on doors.

Phones useless.

Five tough men small outside.

  

Inside, my hands ran the system.

Every click mine.

Every lock theirs.

Nice to meet you.

Now die in the cold.

  

I walked his rooms.

Drives pulled one by one.

Empire bleeding in my hands.

Black boxes heavy as sins.

  

Funny, really.

He thought overdose was a gift.

But this?

This is mine back.

Exit unseen.

The hole only he and the builder knew.

Now me.

Steps fading.

Breath gone.

  

Bridge burned!


=== SONG 14: For You ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: SEP 2019

--- STORY ---
Ethel yells the verdict: “You made a cage. FOR YOU!!!!!".  
  
This track holds all the tension of that three year window spent in her estranged fathers world. The gaslight fog. The psychological shell game.  
  
The man who came to kill her one evening....  
  
Silence isn't free and so this track is loud. Its Heavy Metal.

--- LYRICS ---
Quiet isn't peace

Silence isn't free

I know what this is

This is you

Inside my mind

Inside of my mind

Rearranging my mind


Words tighten

Wire in my throat

I nod

I kneel

No

My mind would choke

Teeth behind glass

They smile too wide

Guilt pours sweet,

While they break my mind

You chose this

You built this

Liar


This isn't care

This isn't kind

This is a cage

Made for my mind

This is the hand

That feeds while it feeds

On me


Build a cage

Fell it age

Jail's coming

Hold fear in

Repeat your wins

Until believed

Tough and real

That's why you steal

Can't hurt me

Won't look good

Not in prison

Soap and cooks


Big man

Underneath

In between

Covered up

Sealed shut


You sell me comfort

While pulling threads

Wrap me quiet

I file anger

To a calm point instead

Breath turns blade

Still, you whisper,


You're afraid

I was

But this isn't fear

This is seeing


You call it loyalty

You call it blood

But you showed me

What you are


This isn't your win

This isn't your spin

This is where

I begin


Grind me down

You can't erase me
 

No safety here

No way to mend

What defends

With what lies so bent

Just breath and burn

Just scream and learn

I was blind

I see you turn
 

Build a cage

Build it new

Jail's here

Not for me

Repeat your wins

Nobody hears

Tough and real

Sucks to be you

Can't hurt me

You're locked down

I'm not in prison

We're not the same

Big man

In the dark

Out of reach

Sealed tight

Lost sight
 

I saw it

I see it

You made a cage
 

For you!!


=== SONG 15: Broken Edge ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: OCT 2019

--- STORY ---
When Ethel met Isla, she met a mind that runs on both chaos and intellect.  
  
Dominic misread her. People don’t usually burn the bridge they’re standing on.  
  
Bet she won’t?

You lose.  


--- LYRICS ---
Numbers whispered, walls so thin

Keys inside the lines

Let chaos win

  

A phone, a pet, her hidden name

One more shot, no rules, just game

Locked away, my mind's my cage

I've burnt before, today's my stage

They call it manic, they name the sin

But clarity cracks when pain breaks in

  

Spent and spun, won't mend, can't hide

A knife edge truth, I'm split inside

Glass mirrors, echoes, screams

Sanity stutters between the seams

  

Dominic's hook, a golden trap

Money glittered, tasted flat

Eighty blown, predictable haze

But clarity cuts in my darkest phase

One hundred down on truth untamed

Shadows filmed, sins unnamed

I boxed it tight, a ticking clock

Her name whispered, key to the lock

  

Spent and spun, won't mend, can't hide

A knife edge truth, I'm split inside

Glass mirrors, echoes, screams

Sanity stutters between the seams

  

Biker flames from digital ink

Burning bridges, didn't think

The man who comes, the man who warns

My mind splits open, reality scorns

Schizophrenic whispers, borderline sway

Brilliant madness lighting my way

I'm not evil

I'm not fine

Chaos spun design is mine

  

A barroom fury, whiskey sharp

Scattered bottles, broken harp

Words like bullets, truths like glass

My laughter bitter as moments pass

Dominic's mistake, saw simple vice

But twisted edges aren't so nice

I'll burn us both, no price too steep

Clarity lives where madness sleeps

  

Spent and spun, won't mend, can't hide

A knife edge truth, I'm split inside

Glass mirrors, echoes, screams

Sanity stutters between the seams

  

I'm the fracture in perfect lies

A broken edge that won't disguise


=== SONG 16: Hero Killer ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: FEB 2020 (TRIAL OPENING)

--- STORY ---
The song sits at the start of a trial that’s been years coming.  
  
Dominic’s myth is crumbling in real time and Ethel’s not here to mourn it.  

--- LYRICS ---
They called him Builder.

Protector.

Said he got things done.

Broke some eggs?

That was the phrase.

Omelette on the table, 

Never mind who hit the floor first.

They said he saved me once.

Stopped a man inches away.

But no one asked

Why the man was there at all.

Builder! Protector! 

Hero! Killer!

Every wall he raised,  

Someone buried under.

Builder! 

Hero! Killer!

Applause is the cover,

But the cracks keep showing.

  

Killer instinct.

Visionary drive.

Sounds fine

When you’re safe in the seats.

I’ve seen it up close.

Instinct cuts.

Drive leaves marks.

Vision carves out the body.

  

Builder! Protector! 

Hero! Killer!

Every wall he raised, 

Someone buried under.

Builder! 

Hero! Killer!

The silence pays the bill,

And the crowd just claps along.

I've got the same refusal to back down.

Difference is, 

I don’t turn it on the unarmed,  

With proof in silence and bodies!

  

Builder! Protector! 

Hero! Killer!

Every wall he raised, 

Someone buried under.

Builder! 

Hero! Killer!

Applause hides the blood,

But the cracks keep showing.

  

Some call it alpha.

Some call it ruthless.

I call it cost, 

Paid by someone else,

Never by the one clapping.

Applause hides it.

Headlines dress it.

But silence, 

Silence keeps the debt alive.

  

Builder! Protector! 

Hero! Killer!

Every wall he raised, 

Someone buried under.

Builder! 

Hero! Killer!

No applause can smother, 

The cracks keep showing.

  

So call him, 

Builder! Protector! Hero!

But don’t act surprised

When the missing people

Were part of the design.

Hero!

Killer!

=== SONG 17: Hero Complex ===
ARTIST: Dominic
DATE: FEB 2020 (THE TRIAL START)

--- STORY ---
Dominic sells himself as the steady one who moves when others freeze. In practice he waits, watches who hesitates, then steps in so people remember the move and forget the pause. It is control dressed as calm.  
  
Rescue buys loyalty. Favors turn into a tab.  
  
Violence, when he uses it, feels routine. He smiles, people relax, but their gut still tightens. They want to believe him. The song puts that pull beside the unease and the contradictions, so the shine and the damage sit in the same light.

--- LYRICS ---
Show me a man who never missed,

And I’ll show you one

Who never moved.

Show me the one who froze,

And I’ll show you

The first to fall.

  

The hand that acts first

Is the hand remembered.

Pause too long,

And you vanish.

They’ll call it reckless.

They always do.

Then later they’ll say

It saved them.

  

I hold steady. I hold steady.

When the storm breaks. I don’t move.

When the crowd runs. I don’t move.

Not above you. Not above you.

Not beside you. Not beside you.

Right where the silence

Turns the tide.

  

We hold steady. We hold steady.

We keep rhythm. We keep rhythm.

We take burden. We take burden.

So the world won’t break apart.

Not above you. Not above you.

Not beside you. Not beside you.

We are the weight,

We are the hand,

We are the silence

That turns the tide.

  

I steadied one once,

Pulled him back.

They named it brave.

Another time,

I didn’t.

Same hand, same breath.

The room still clapped.

  

Every tower stands

On something buried.

Every oath

Draws from blood unseen.

Heroes don’t confess it.

They just let you believe.

That’s the service.

  

Still in every phrase like a shadow.

We hold steady. We hold steady.

We keep rhythm. We keep rhythm.

So the world won’t fall apart.

  

Decisions don’t wait.

That’s why they’re mine.

And one day

You’ll thank me

For not asking.



=== SONG 18: Nothing True ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: APR 2020 (THE TESTIMONY)

--- STORY ---
Ethel takes the stand knowing the court wants clarity. A yes or a no. But she knows her father’s methods, how stories get reshaped and reused. The lawyers don’t.  
  
She answers carefully. Leaves nothing that can be twisted later.  
  
It looks cautious, even rigid, but it isn’t. It’s foresight, drawn from knowing exactly what’s at stake.  

--- LYRICS ---
They asked the questions  

like answers were furniture,   

Placed. Neat,  

waiting to be sat on.  

  

I didn’t sit.  

They wanted yes.  

They wanted no.  

They wanted a box  

with no cracks to show.  

  

But rooms don’t arrange like you dream.  

Truth scatters, overlaps,  

fractures in the seams.  

  

Nothing true. Nothing!  

Nothing refuted. Refuted!  

Every word a hinge,  

every silence disputed.  

  

Nothing true.  

Nothing refuted.  

The record feels certain,  

but the room knew it muted.  

  

They logged my pauses  

as if time betrayed me.  

But silence isn’t absence.  

It’s a tactic they gave me.  

  

Every nod they scribbled  

missed the flame beneath.  

They weighed my cadence,  

but forgot the teeth.  

Nothing true. Nothing!  

Nothing refuted. Refuted!  

Every word a hinge,  

every silence disputed.  

  

Nothing true.  

Nothing refuted.  

The record feels certain,  

but the room knew it muted.  

  

Evidence stacks.  

Stories move.  

They carry the frame,  

not the proof.  

  

Ask yourself:  

if closure feels so smooth,  

why do echoes  

still bruise the room?  

Nothing true. NOTHING!  

Nothing refuted. REFUTED!  

Every word a hinge,  

every silence disputed.  

  

Nothing true. NOTHING!  

Nothing refuted. REFUTED!  

The record feels certain,  

but the room knew it muted.  

  

Be careful.  

Lies don’t just serve you,   

they serve him too.


=== SONG 19: You Will Thank Me Later ===
ARTIST: Dominic
DATE: JUN 2020 (PRISON)

--- STORY ---
In the cold, structured walls of prison, Dominic finds his next project. His new cellmate. Not with a show of force. Not with threats. But with a calm voice in a room where the loud have already lost.  
  
This is Dominic’s song: A calm, rhythmic guide to turning trust into currency, and a willing man into a spent resource.  
  
Step 1: Remove doubt.  
Step 2: Remove choice without them noticing. Keep your voice even. Match their rhythm.  
  
Step 3: Give them something harmless to do  
Step 4: Give them something important to do  
Step 4: Finally give them something they can’t take back.  
  
Never rush. Never ask twice.  
  
By the time they see the pattern, you’re already holding the ending.

--- LYRICS ---
Not every door is meant to open.

Not every weight is yours to lift.

Is really yours.

  

But that's good.

That's safety.

That's why I'm here.

  

Tired?

Of guessing.

Of watching.

Of wondering.

  

I get that.

Structure helps.

Rules save time.

Obedience clears space.

Why hold burdens

That I already know

How to carry?

  

Just...

Follow clean.

You'll see.

  

You will rest.

(You will.)

  

You will see.

(You will.)

  

You will let go.

(You will.)

  

You will need me.

(You will.)

  

Anger burns fast.

Noise burns faster.

Plans?

They cloud.

  

But rhythm?

That's power.

  

I don't shout.

I don't clash.

  

I hold steady.

While others thin out.

  

Stay near.

Stay easy.

  

I build.

You borrow.

  

That's how you win.

That's how I win.

  

Look around.

See them rush?

See them grasp?

  

Soon they'll ask me.

Not because they lost.

Because they want to stop losing.

  

Smart, really.

Better to lean

than be left.

  

You will rest.

(You will.)

  

You will see.

(You will.)

  

You will let go.

(You will.)

  

You will need me.

(You will.)

  

No need to run.

No need to reach.

No need to doubt.

  

You already decided.

You already asked.

You just didn't

know it.

  

But that's why

you'll thank me later.


=== SONG 20: This Isn't Therapy ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: AUG 2020 (POST-TRIAL RESET)

--- STORY ---
This isn't therapy begins after Dominic's trial ends, in an inner west Sydney flat she never asked for but couldn’t refuse. The walls are hers, though the reason why isn’t spoken.  
  
Expelled from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music after a clash that no one can quite retell the same way, Isla continues pushing her musical career with a band drawn from those who saw the same fire others tried to discipline out of her.  
  
The song is her reset. A refusal to apologies for intensity. It’s reclamation of a sort, the sound of someone testing out how to turn what broke her into something that can’t be contained.

--- LYRICS ---
They said I was too loud for strings,  

Too cold for jazz,  

Too sharp for theory,  

Too something for a room full of legacies,  

With softer scars.

  

I didn’t beg.  

I didn’t break.  

I just stopped speaking in key.

I hit C like a hammer.  

Let it ring like a name you don’t say anymore.

You pulled me out of the class  

Like I pulled truth from Dominic’s fucking phone.  

You said I was angry.  

I said I was awake.

  

I was born in a house full of secrets  

With a staircase built from silence.  

Now I scream in tune.  

You call that unstable?  

I call it restraint.

  

You should’ve let me play.  

Instead you taught me to fracture.  

Now every chord is a warning.  

And every show’s a threat  

I make beautiful.

  

I didn’t ask for the flat.  

Didn’t ask for the blood money guilt nest.  

But I took it.  

  

Because survival’s not a statement,  

It’s logistics.

  

Petersham windows don’t ask questions.  

They just show you where the sky ends.  

That’s how I learned to write without asking.  

To practice until my hands remembered  

What my brain was trying to forget.

  

They said I should’ve calmed down.  

I said they should’ve noticed sooner.  

I said I was leaving.  

The walls said thank you.

  

I was raised by a man who taught law  

But never learned mercy.  

By a woman who smiled like she was drowning  

And no one asked if she could swim.

  

You want to call me unstable?  

Try calling me in range.  

You should’ve let me play.  

Now I don’t need your permission.  

I bring noise like scripture  

And I don’t miss.

  

He taught me silence.  

She taught me how to wear it.  

They taught me how to lie for love.  

I taught myself to stay alive without forgetting.

  

Now the band plays,  

And I don’t apologise  

For what happens next.

  

This isn’t therapy.  

This is proof.  

This isn’t anger.  

This is discipline.  

This isn’t your story.  

It’s mine  

With the names burned out  

  

But the sound intact.

You should’ve let me play.

That’s Isla.  

Not sad, not unstable, not mythologised.  

Operational. Lethal. Grounded. Played out.

  

Not seeking peace  

Building power  

From every system that tried to contain her.

  

You want more from this session?  

The verse she freestyles backstage?  

The moment in rehearsal when the rest of the band realises she’s not even trying yet?

  

Just say so.

Isla's here now.


=== SONG 21: Intro to Shiny Headed Man ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: SEP 2020

--- STORY ---
The intro song to "Shiny headed Man" sets the stage for what comes next.  
  
She’s chasing an audition that could change everything, but the man who promised to open the door expects payment that isn’t music. Typical. Isla’s answer isn’t retreat but confrontation wrapped in humour and noise.  
  
The song catches her mid-decision, half-laughing, half-ready to detonate and very concerned underneath it all. She knows his type all to well.  
  
If the bridge burns, so be it. She’ll build her own stage from the ashes and make it louder.

--- LYRICS ---
He’s sleazy as xxxx

Yeah but he knows the band  

Do I need him?  

We don't need  

What’s he gonna do?  

Same as he’s done before  

But,  

It’s,  

Twenty,  

Twenty,  

Five?  

Yeah,  

Some are still around  

So?  

So?

  

We frighten the shit out of him  

And we prove we should be in the band

  

He’s a sleezy chimp headed man  

That’s rude  

But true  

So if we burn the bridge  

Then we do what we always do

  

We frighten the shit out of him  

And we prove we should be in the band

  

And if the bridge is burnt  

Fuck it,  

Let’s just be me  

Yeah,  

Frighten the fuck out of him  

Still concerning  

Just make noise Isla


=== SONG 22: Shiny Headed Radio Man ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: SEP 2020

--- STORY ---
Shiny Headed Radio Man is Isla Unleashed. Raw, furious, and done with the gatekeepers.  
  
All she wants is the audition the band promised, but the man holding the door treats access like currency. Sleaze wrapped in influence. Isla gives him exactly what he fears. No compliance. No charm. No apology.  
  
The song spirals between humor and confrontation, performance and real anger. It’s the sound of a woman refusing to barter her worth for permission, turning a power imbalance into a public reckoning, one scream at a time.  

--- LYRICS ---
Radio host  

Studio room  

Not shiny like his head  

Radio bad boy yaps crap, nose sniff, mirror hum  

Same deeeeal  

Door creaks  

Eyes wide  

I screeeeeaaammmaarrooohhaarrrrrr  

Walls peel  

Assistant pokes her head in  

More eyes

Best if he’s  

Frightened  

Shiny boy looks  

Disturbed

  

Am I a girl?  

Am I?  

How do you know?  

I’m not  

No, I am  

But do you know?  

Do they want a girl  

Or a boy?  

The dead singer band  

Bring back the bad boy  

They can’t  

He’s dead

  

Maybe I’m a bad boy  

I can sound like a man  

Are you a man?  

Shiny head man  

A persistent man  

Learn the sentence

  

No  

No  

No  

No no no  

xxxx you no  

You have bat rabies  

Just take me to the xxxxing band  

  

Ozzy bat rabies  

Any spare bats?  

I’m the new crazy  

You need me  

’Cause they need me  

Shiny head rabies man  

Wants to give me babies  

Shiny head babies  

Just take me to the band  

Not happening  

Shiny head man  

Just take me to the band

  

I’m a man  

You’re a man  

Not gonna happen  

Shiny head man  

Money, money  

Crap trap cash man  

Know the band?  

I know what you want  

xxxx you shiny head man  

Just take me to the band

  

They want me  

They need me  

I’m dirt layered on nitrate  

You’re just dirt  

Just get me the xxxxing audition  

You’ll be happy  

They need my vocal sledge

  

I’m not biting the head off your ---- bat


=== SONG 23: Stanmore Farewell ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: DEC 2020 (INNER-WEST EXIT)

--- STORY ---
Stanmore Farewell finds Isla after the noise has faded. The trial of Dominic has ended. The headlines have stopped including her with titles like "Addict Girl". Things seem almost normal.  
  
She’s living in a small flat in Sydney’s inner west, paid for with money she’ll never discuss, playing gigs that half the crowd forgets and half will never stop talking about.  
  
The song captures the push and pull between gratitude and restlessness. Loving the band she pulled together from the con.The small but creatively raw shows. The life she’s built.  
  
It’s not a goodbye in anger, but in necessity. Isla knows she can’t stay still.

--- LYRICS ---
Small flat, inner west,  

Guilt money lights the walls  

They ask questions,  

Cause the look don’t fit right

Own it?  

Yeah!  

But not going there

  

Opal tap says go, metro drum says maybe  

Inner west windows cough TV light into the lane  

My mates set up at the pub, kick, bass, guitar,  

Good times for the most part, thin ice  

I want more than good times,  

Shame climbs the throat

  

The Con sent a disagreement,  

Didn’t shake my hand  

I answered with a downstroke  

Call it less than polite, fine,  

I learned counterpoint in the mess,  

Pushed it down the line

  

Sydney seems to want me still, it's a joke  

Can’t maintain the fill, too much inner spill

  

Could catch a long flight in my head, never come back  

Or find a side door in this suburb, make it famous  

Safety net looks soft until it knots around the ankle  

  

Love my band, love inner west life, hate the thoughts

  

They plug in, I tune within, feed back the dust  

We hit first song, the floor nods, few but loyal  

They want me grounded, I keep tasting runway  

Guilty for the thought, guilty for the wish, still mine

  

She’s from the Con, quiet eyes, wrong light  

Men watch me like I’m that,  

Then get the stare, read the tell,  

See the gap, walk it back,  

Now sing it with me, unmark that trap,  

  

I’ll unpack the noise, sing what we can’t

  

I try not to hurt those who helped with a steadier will  

But I won’t stay still, to maintain the fill

  

Could catch a long flight in my head, never come back  

Or find a side door in this suburb, make it famous  

Safety net looks soft until it knots around the ankle  

Love my band, my inner west life, hate the way my head talks

  

Side street coffee steam, memory set on sill  

Click, a photo for a future me, set on the sill  

Emails from overseas, maybe if you scream brighter  

  

I write back, maybe if you can stand my light

  

I don’t owe a thing for the payments  

I don’t owe the city a softer version  

They'll know my why if I leave right  

They’ll hate my question if I stay wrong

  

What I want, line of sight, drop the key, drop my fear  

She feels my switch, lets it be, I note the catch  

The rest tilt toward yes as if it’s the same breath  

I give them a brand new ending they didn’t ask for

  

No encore, just a click off and a stare  

They hear it, that’s farewell, without the sell

  

I caught a long flight from my head, maybe I’ll be back  

Not going to find a side door in this suburb  

Safety net holds the still like a knot around the ankle  

Loved my band, my inner west life, but my head would spill

  

Sold the matchbox flat, expensive sill  

I packed too little, took too much  

Text the band, I’m on a plane  

  

Best friend, she already knew

  

Might not work, but can’t have the question


=== SONG 24: Harm's Ghost ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: FEB 2021 (POST-TRIAL AFTERMATH)

--- STORY ---
Harm’s Ghost pulls you inside Ethel’s head, into the space between instinct and restraint.  
  
She sees what others either miss or refuse to confront out of fear or uncertainty.  
  
It isn’t about fear or control. It’s about the moment people see harm coming, know it can be stopped, and still choose to stay quiet.

--- LYRICS ---
It's not belief, it's balance

It's not doubt, it's damage

It's not panic, it's pattern

I move with consequence managed

  

You say I'm certain?

I'm not I'm close

I just act when I know the harm's ghost

  

You think I'm wrong?

I might be

But if I'm off?, I shift quietly

  

I rewind convos like film with a fault

Not from fear, I'm just running the vault

  

Don't make noise

Don't cut through

Don't raise hands when the rule book's blue

  

Maybe they didn't mean harm…

So why's my gut flex like it ate an alarm?

  

Maybe it couldn't be foreseen

Then why's my brain flash red on the scene? 

  

"You're dramatic"

"You overreact"

Read that line in a thousand acts

  

No, I'm not your fear on legs

I just know what happens when no one checks

  

If I see pain comin'

And I freeze for peace?

That's not restraint, that's a moral breach

  

I know the codes

I know the acts

I've done the script dressed in tact

  

Wore safe words

Wore "balanced" tones

Wore "measured" masks that weren't my own

  

Survival shape 

But not my shape

Cut those ropes when the line got fake

  

It's not belief , it's balance

It's not doubt, it's damage

It's not panic, it's pattern

I move with consequence managed

  

You say I'm certain?

I'm not I'm close

I just act when I know the harm's ghost

  

You think I'm wrong?

I might be

But if I'm off?, I shift quietly

  

Justice ain't slow for social ease

It's sorting moves you don't believe

  

Clarity don't need your nod

It shows up sharp and never soft

  

Some move fast 'cause doubt delays

They bank on fear to clear their plays

  

So while you're paused

Weighing shame

They're three steps in

Rewriting names

  

Me? I move

When the damage is nil

If I get it wrong

I pay that bill

  

Wrong fast

Own it

Adjust

But I won't let harm in

just 'cause it looks just

I don't think binary

I read terrain

Signals gaps

And tight domain

  

I see who flexes

Who ducks the frame

Who leaves silence

And plays the game

  

If I'm right 

You're safe tonight

If I'm wrong 

I realign right

  

But I won't fold

For the crowd's appeal

They taught me "pause"

Means "ignore what's real"

  

I learned that fear's

got fancy clothes

But it's still a muzzle

When courage shows

  

And no 

I'm not on the sell

I just spot the burn

Before it swells

  

It's not faith, it's reflex

It's not hunch, it's math and mess

It's not rage, it's read and risk

It's not wrong to move like this

  

You say I'm sharp?

You're not wrong

I track where silence drags too long

  

You think I'm off?

Possibly

But I don't sit still where harm could be

  

Call it instinct

Call it grace

Call it action

That holds its place

  

Certainty's cousin  

Not its clone

I move when the stakes

Cut straight to bone

  

It gives me ground

Lets me speak

Lets me draw that

sharp technique

  

But I won't live in it

It's not my truth

Just a way to move

With a jagged proof

  

If you need it?

You're off the mark

Fast moves

But in the dark

  

Too late to shift

Too far gone

That's not me

  

I'm still on



=== SONG 25: No Sparrow Caught Mid Flight ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: DEC 2020 (POST-TRIAL)

--- STORY ---
The trial’s done. He’s where he belongs. She’s finished what she started. Now comes the quiet part. The part left after.  
  
Ethel's name is still in the headlines. Her face is still tied to his. Work’s meant to follow study, but nothing lands. Maybe that’s coincidence, maybe not.  
  
The song is about what remains when one dramatic story ends and movement is all that’s left. Ethel doesn't want to be turned into his echo or his correction.  
--- LYRICS ---
They gave him a room with a lock and steel

Gave me a road with no fixed wheels

He's got a bed four walls a name

I've got streetlights that forget the same

  

He counts his days in rising dust

I count my steps past places I trust

He's got a view that never shifts

I trade mine every time I  cross borders

  

Don't hang your hopes on some slow star

Don't carve my name where your heroes are

I'm no sparrow caught mid-flight

I break clean I hold no light

  

They said I wore the noise too thin

Took no trophies took no spin

But I just needed ground that stayed

Not walls that begged to be repaid

I don't trace maps  I crack the floor

I don't weave back  I mark the door

If it hollows I let it through

If it stumbles I don't undo

  

Don't hang your hopes on some slow star

Don't carve my name where your heroes are

I'm no sparrow caught mid-flight

I break clean I hold no light

  

They said I wore the noise too thin

Took no trophies took no spin

But I just needed ground that stayed

Not walls that begged to be repaid

  

I don't trace maps  I crack the floor

I don't weave back  I mark the door

If it hollows I let it through

If it stumbles I don't undo

  

Don't hang your hopes on some slow star

Don't carve my name where your heroes are

I'm no sparrow caught mid-flight

I break clean I hold no light

  

If I look slow I'm counting cracks

If I sound gone I'm marking tracks

Every tilt each hollow thread

Where old maps call the living dead

  

So I fixed the wire not the frame

Moved the mark where no hands claim

Stacked their wrecks outside the night

So no one else rewrites that fight

I don't wear grief like soft designs

I ride the noise and call the signs

And when it hums when it cuts clean

I keep the thread outside unseen

And when it hums when it cuts clean

I keep the thread outside unseen


=== SONG 26: Dominic's Escape ===
ARTIST: Dominic
DATE: JAN 2024 (THE ESCAPE)

--- STORY ---
Dominic understands the average person the way others read instructions. He learned by testing limits others never would, the kind that press on the meeting point of empathy, reason, and self-interest.  
  
Most people stop there. Dominic doesn’t. He watches for random mistakes, sometimes a reaction to the pressure he applies, sometimes pure chance. It makes no difference.  
  
Dominic notices the needs, the mistakes, the misplaced trust, the small openings people leave, and he exploits them fearlessly and without hesitation.

--- LYRICS ---
Tray lands

She taps once

Doesn't meet my eye

That's better

  

Cuffs presented

I extend the wrists

She tightens one

Leaves the other convenient

  

He nods

Doesn't verify

They never do

If your rhythm matches their system

  

One buzz

Latch hums

Shoes on tile

Same song New verse

  

Pen clicks

Clipboard lifts

She adjusts posture 

Small things that say belief

  

He watches her

I watch him

His gaze drags just a little late

That's where I live

  

No suspicion

Just pacing

If you speak in rhythm

People stop hearing what you say

  

I give them space

They fill it in

Call it certainty

Call it gut

I call it mine

  

I don't lie

I sequence

They don't check

They complete

  

One omission

Two suggestions

You think you thought it

That's enough

  

No walls hold what I can thin

No chains bind what slides within

You follow codes

I reroute signs

Game's not won 

Until I decide

  

She says "We've met"

I glance sideways

She writes the meeting into memory

Smiles like it always happened

  

He opens a path

No one told him to

That's the best kind of obedience 

The kind that feels like instinct

  

I never gave a name

But she recalls one

Wasn't mine

Still it works

  

Call it charm

Call it misdirection

I call it removal

Of friction Of doubt

  

A gesture lands

A glance misreads

They build the rest

I walk inside it

  

Their logic fills the holes I leave

I don't raise alarms

I just set the tempo

  

No walls hold what I can thin

No chains bind what slides within

You check corners

I check keys

Game's not done 

Not 'til I leave

  

Doing okay?

He asks

I shift my eyes 

Not fast Not loud

  

He turns

Predictable

  

She lifts the form

Eyes snag on a name

Something off 

But not enough

  

You'd be amazed

How many crimes

Are made possible

By courtesy

  

Door opens

Air moves

Paper flicks

  

They remember sound

But not shape

Not me

  

Gone isn't a moment

It's a series of permissions

No one knew they gave

  

No walls hold what I can thin

No chains bind what slides within

You check corners

I check keys

Game's not done 

Not 'til I leave

  

They'll count the exits

Check the footage

Make the calls

  

They won't find me

Not yet


=== SONG 27: Kinley (Guilt Money) ===
ARTIST: Kinley
DATE: FEB 2024 (EMERGENCE)

--- STORY ---
In the void left after Dominic there are new contenders. Kinsley is best seen as the system embodied. A presence that cannot be beaten. Only endured or outmaneuvered. Where Ethel seeks clarity, Kinsley deals in optics, leverage, and survival politics.  
  
Kinley is the handler archetype, polished, professional, polite on the surface, but always calculating.  

--- LYRICS ---
A phrase I say playbook rehearsed

Mental tone same zone same verse

Seems it came from my family's good line

But I bent and split it with a political spine

They all got brains polished degrees that's fine

Wasn't chasing praise just a visible bloodline

And when my storm rolled in dead quiet

No words hit the mark no one tried it

  

Guilt money Guilt money

Target drawn my inner pact

Didn't know couldn't act

And here I come with paper stacks

Plans I wrote fine-tuned with time

Too late for truth just political spine

  

Thirty years the clock was wound

Held me off and held me down

Learnt from falls played it straight

Walked through walls called it political fate

Hard to see me if you want to trust

Hard to break through my charm and rust

But time reveals even though brief

Occasional cracks in my self-belief

  

Guilt money Guilt money

Bullseye lit in legalese

If it sticks I split no fees

No one looking no one sees

It's all too twisted for simple minds

So they shrug it off call it fine

  

Felt nothing for the man who died

He cut me slow and smiled wide

Million marks to contain his flame

  

They rode the wave never took the blame

Moved it quick behind closed walls

Made the call or I'd lose it all

No remorse no time to stall

Just get it done and watch him fall

  

Guilt money Guilt money

You don't speak you just agree

If you see me I'll make you bleed

And when you do it's a relentless feed

I'll tie you in knots with rotten string

I'll just smile and not say a thing

  

Guilt money Guilt money

Let it hit let you rot

It's not about what could've been

It's just about what you are not

Guilt money Guilt money

Let the first word burn


=== SONG 28: Ants On The Vine ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: MAR 2024 (FIRST SIGNAL)

--- STORY ---
Ethel had been waiting on a Sydney train platform when a woman nearby reacted to something she saw on a digital billboard in front of them, as if she had seen something meant only for her. Ethel looked closer at the next ad. Similar tone, same design, but a timestamp in the corner did not belong.  
  
"Ants on the Vine" begins there, as Ethel follows what others overlook. Quiet irregularities. Data that's out of place. A name that should not appear where it does.  
  
Kinley.  
  
What she uncovers suggests it is not a one off. It did not need to say anything. Its timing and location were enough to make the point. Access. You're watched. I can do this and more.  
  
But why?

--- LYRICS ---
People write lines

Ants on the vine

Routines grind down black dirt white sign

Names drift quiet one fell through 

Pushed out clean with no follow-through

Public logs

Staff updates slow

But the timeline snapped

When he let go

No breach no threat

But too exact 

Like someone asked

And he stepped back

GitHub thread

README cracked

Three commits

One name stacked

Smart soft-spoken

Typed too flat

To be angry 

Just coded facts

Blog was old

Just plain black

HTML

No SEO

and one mid-line:

Kinley said he'd help

He never said they used me

But you could tell

He knows

  

Self-serve the lie I'll stitch the cost

Fake the fight I'll rig the loss

I don't shift or sway  I level ground

I built this bite from a heavier sound

  

We talked stack trace

Bug fix chat

  

One odd commit 

Push then retract

Then one drop:

Kinley's name

Soft in tone

But tight in tact

  

I already knew

Spun stories early

Filed first

Made questions dirty

  

Accuse to mute

Reframe the scene

Tool of choice?

Distress  routine

  

PI brief was framed around me

Routine coverage

Plausible need

  

Clipboard man 

same shirt twice

Two locations

Watching the read

  

So I rode

Let the PI shoot

I watched Kinley

on his route

Lunch Four Seasons

No disguise

Like he doesn't care

Who buys the lies

  

I followed slow

Paused inside

Concierge took note

Didn't try

Walked out cool

Air felt strange

Didn't see his face 

But the air had changed

  

Self-serve the lie I'll stitch the cost

Fake the fight I'll rig the loss

I don't shift or sway  I level ground

I built this bite from a heavier sound

  

Home fast

Wrong loop

Still lost him

Half a block too loose

Knows the zone now

Narrow field

Map's been drawn

by what I yield

But Clipboard Man?

Didn't go home

Same step count

Same low tone

No folder

but a timed pause sharp

Plastic satchel

Pressed clasp

Then back to the car

Engine soft

Passenger seat

  

Radio off

Private club

Just above the rail

Members only

No paper trail

Not where you'd expect

A public planner

Twice in a week

  

With no event banner

Doesn't make him guilty

But it's not nothing

Just close enough

To feel like something

  

Self-serve the lie I'll stitch the cost

Fake the fight I'll rig the loss

I don't shift or sway  I level ground

I built this bite from a heavier sound



=== SONG 29: Clipboard Man ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: APR 2024 (SURVEILLANCE LOOP)

--- STORY ---
"Clipboard Man" unfolds like a quiet chase told in reverse. Ethel knows clipboard man isn’t her threat. He’s a signal. A reflection. He's part of a larger thing that needs eyes and ears for its own protection.  
  
When surveillance starts to fold back on itself, she sets her own decoy in motion. She hires a private investigator as a second set of eyes. A moving mirror.  
  
What follows is assessment without panic. Hotels, side streets, small cues that build into proof. Kinley’s people are tracking Ethel but Ethel is also tracking them.

--- LYRICS ---
He's not my threat

He's my reflection

If they're watching him

they're reading my direction

He's not their man

He's in my plan

  

Up before noon

Shared kitchen tension

No conversation

just the sound of someone

wondering where I go that early

No plan

Just distance

Ten k inbound

Dash light cold

Mirror clean

Motor warm

  

Didn't brief the PI

Didn't name the threat

Said just enough to make it legal

Said little enough to keep it useful

He logs my loop

But the trick isn't what he sees

It's who sees him

If they trace him?

They'll find a real license

Real pay

Real reason

Not their reason

Mine

  

Side street

Black bike

Kickstand soft

Four Seasons

Kinley 1:10

Exit cue

different tie

same woman

I walked in

Slight glance

Just filed it

Not scandal

Just routine

He doesn't see me

Not really

But he feels it

That flick in the spine

When something's been logged

  

Split at the fountain

I peeled right

Bike just ahead

And parked nearby

Clipboard

Not flashy

Not branded

Grey beard

Thinning hair

Didn't write

Didn't read

Just… carried it

That's when I named him

Not "the man"

Not "the tail"

Clipboard Man

  

He's not my threat

He's my reflection

If they're watching him

They're reading my direction

He's not their man

He's in my plan

And that's why

I named him:

Clipboard Man

  

Back on the bike

Rocks behind me

Harbour bridge ahead

Kinley stlyed south

  

I didn't

Wind sharp

Mirrors steady

Clipboard tailing

  

Two cars back

Low gear wrong lane

But rhythm matched

That's not coincidence

That's rehearsal

  

I cut north

Didn't rush

Just broke line of sight

In the turn

He slowed

Didn't stop

Didn't search

My guy kept with him

Just back one set

Let the rhythm reset

Clipboard rolled into

A side-industrial patch

  

Not sketchy

Just not coffee

Stayed parked

Fifteen minutes

Glove box lean

Phone glance

No call

  

Then:

A bag from the passenger side

Not groceries

Just enough

To get logged

  

My PI stayed on him

Not close

Not loud

Just long enough

To make it seem

Coincidental

Clipboard cut east

Didn't call

Silver sedan

Front seat

No plates worth logging

Ten minutes later:

Warehouse block

  

Quiet

Not quiet-quiet

Just "extra"

Not illegal

Just… indicative

  

He's not my threat

He's my reflection

If they're watching him

They're reading my direction

He's not their man

He's in my plan

And that's why

I named him:

Clipboard Man



=== SONG 30: Rattled ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: MAY 2024 (DETECTIVE INTERVENTION)

--- STORY ---
"Rattled" unfolds through the voice of Detective “Sticky,” a man who spots trouble faster than protocol allows. He’s sharp, impatient, allergic to small talk, and just self-aware enough to know it. When Ethel crosses his path, he recognises the type. Too bright. Too direct. Too unwilling to wait for systems that crawl.  
  
The song becomes their collision point. He sees her drive and the potential danger in it. The way she mirrors her old man’s edge without meaning to. It isn’t a warning aimed to hurt or out of pity. Its actually a helping hand born from experience.  
  
Sticky knows what happens when conviction moves too faster and when small jabs get a reaction. He can just tell that someone’s going to test that.  
  
Sticky has an abrasive style that is weirdly kind and compassionate. He's best seen as a very kind stoic man who has experienced it all and seen it all before and often speaks truth not to hurt but to help - like training ones immune system for a later encounter. With Ethel he sees a strong young women with enormous potential who is also bruised, justice sensitive and doesn't see some of her weak spots that others, like Kinley, will see and use and so he pokes them as a way to prepare Ethel rather than hurt. He also sees a part of her that might be prone to over correcting injustice and going too far if the right set of circumstances arise.
--- LYRICS ---
Some things you don't chase.

You let'em run.

Trail the echoes.

Wait for the turn.

  

They sent me a file.

Couple of lines. 

Flagged.

Interference. 

Pressure.

Name.

Kinley.

Not again. Another one.

Complaint retracted next morning

Told me all I needed.

They don't retract 'cause it's fine.

They retract when clout and teeth work.

  

  

Then came her. Too sure.

Frayed order.

Parts I'd never seen put together like that.

Redhead.

Eyes like she sees the tech behind your head.

Came at me.

USB and a mission.

Didn't ask. Didn't wait.

Like the world was wrong

when it should be right.

I thought: Another Smart, Dumb kid.

Mistaking instinct for rule.

So I looked her up.

Holy #$%!!

  

The Daughter of...

Dominic Ryker.

Everyone remembers that trial.

She was what

Seventeen?

Put that #$% inside.

On that stand. Alone. Five months.

Seasoned cops break from that. She didn't.

Did it with that pointed look.

Testified like someone who knew.

  

Alright. Not a kid. Not soft.

Not bluffing...

But.. interfering.

  

  

And now...

Oh #%^&.

She took a government job.

Systems analyst.

I laughed. 

Jesus

Here we go.

Playing Kinley's game

back on itself.

Access. Fast pulse. Impulse posed

In red.

Funny. But not.

She's not stable. Not yet.

No anchor. Just velocity.

Hope that brain sees itself.

Dangerous

Even to allies.

She sees. She acts.

But the law doesn't move like her pulse.

And that guy? Kinley?

He doesn't get caught like that.

He chokes you with procedure.

Gives people legal seizure.

Frames your response as the problem.

Publicly. Repeatedly. Aggressively.

Hands out of frame.

  

And her?

"Input!"

"Output!"

"Jail!"

  

"Done yet?!"

"Why not?!"

"System's broke!"

"Fix it!!"

"Now!!!!"

Wash.

Repeat.

  

But this game's rigged.

Runs slow.

But you already know.

But what about your why?

Your why?

What about a non tech job.

As a cop.

Oh I know

Systems suck.

  

And those defenses?

I see the cracks.

Do you?

  

You're not the hero just 'cause you're right.

Not if no one follows.

Not if they break trying.

Not if the truth burns the bridge.

  

You wanna know what I told her?

You will be reckless.

You will lose allies.

You will be a problem

If you don't think.

I can see you think.

Correct?

  

You don't like being told who you are.

Do you?

You don't like feeling manipulated.

Do you?

What about a man with weaponised info?

Money.

Connections. Access.

  

Who says you're like your old man. 

In public?

You're not. But your guard's not locked.

You respond If caught off guard.

That rattle I can see

Someone's going to rattle it.

So I'm letting you know.

Don't be reckless.

She stepped back.

  

Like she saw a dumb guy reach into her mind

And point at something she thought was hidden.

It hit. It hurt. She thought she could spot me.

It woke her up. I meant it to.

She was silent. Like she was thinking her way out of her own future. 

Just for a moment.

One more thing.

  

People with keys don't like smart!!

I know

  

Some things you don't chase.

You let 'em burn.

But this one here...

She might just turn.



=== SONG 31: Red Stick ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: JUN 2024 (FIRST TEST)

--- STORY ---
It begins with a test. Subtle. Deliberate. Seemingly harmless.  
  
A red stick wedged in the front wheel of her bike. Nothing dramatic, nothing random. A message to measure reaction.  
  
The song follows Ethel as she reads it the way others read handwriting. She notes the placement, the red kite across the street it came from, the intent. Every detail feels rehearsed, designed to watch her thinking, not stop her movement.  
  
From there, the pieces widen. A glimpse from a balcony. A man in a blue sweater. A man expecting a different reaction and now making mistakes. A business card on the street with Kinley’s name.  
  
It is not a threat in the usual sense. It is a signal from people who test before they act. This time Ethel reads it early and answers on her own terms.

--- LYRICS ---
There are things you learn 

When life stops pulling punches 

And starts aiming for the gut.

  

That you can’t get from a book,

Or a podcast,

Or hearing it second-hand

From someone who tells you they’ve made peace with it.

  

It doesn’t always land the first time, either.

Some people go through it

And come out thinking it was just hard.

But some of us

Note the shapes

That burn around the edges.

  

You learn what matters

After the noise drops out.

How you move.

How you’re read.

How you’re misread.

How quickly some people

Will decide what your silence means, 

When they’ve never seen too many possibilities  think.

  

An then... some of us 

We start to realize

That the things we were told were weaknesses

Were never soft.

They just didn’t translate well.

  

It’s not about toughness.

It’s about precision.

About knowing the cause,

The action,

The impact, 

And who cops it.

  

Because I’ve felt the hit.

Not in the abstract.

Not in metaphor.

But in the way that leaves you

With a second sense

For tension,

For tells in posture,

For methods.

So when I walked outside that morning,

Slid on the gloves,

Checked the brakes,

And saw the red stick

Slotted straight,

Dead center

Between front wheel and frame, 

  

Smooth.

Unsplintered.

Dry.

  

I didn’t pause.

I did the math in silence.

That stick wasn’t kicked up.

Wasn’t dropped.

It was placed.

  

Vertical.

Dead straight.

Zero bounce.

  

It wasn’t random.

It wasn’t angry.

It was someone testing

How long I take to react.

How fast my eyes track anomalies.

Whether I ride anyway.

Whether I rage.

Whether I report.

Or whether I keep moving

Like nothing happened.

So I did none of those.

  

I picked it up,

Put it in my pack,

And left the bike where it was.

  

No statement.

No sudden turn.

  

Across the street 

A park.

Half a red tail caught in a branch.

Too low to be missed,

Too high for a kid to reach.

  

I scanned.

Behind me,  shops.

To the right,  a pub,

Breakfast menu chalked up out front.

Second floor balcony.

  

Beyond the park, 

Just units.

Private. Forgettable.

  

The pub?

That’s the vantage.

  

  

I crossed,

Grabbed the kite, 

It came easy.

  

Back to the bike.

Pack open.

Kite in.

Engine kick off.

I pulled up fast,

Park it quickly.

Through the door,

Up the stairs,

Onto the balcony.

  

Still-warm coffee.

Uneaten croissant.

Napkin scribbled on.

Chair still observing.

  

Then I see him.

Blue sweater.

Jeans.

Grey hair, thin build.

Crossing the street below.

Glance up.

We see each other.

  

Then he’s walking, 

Not rushing,

But not slow, 

Toward the only street

You might find a park

On a weekday before noon.

  

I go the long way.

Round the block.

  

I’m faster.

I run.

Just as I round the bend,

I see the grey sedan.

Driver-side door closing.

Engine low.

Gone before I get there.

  

But up at the curb?

A business card.

Face down.

Fluttering.

  

Not placed.

Dropped.

Like an accident

In peak hour.

  

Councilor Ross Kinley. 

No Facebook....

But this friend of his has one.

  

And his friend

Is too proud.

Tagline-proud.

Name-drop proud.

Smile-next-to-the-mayor proud.

  

Same beard.

Same sweater.

Dumb-smart.

Where the latter

Hasn’t yet met the former.

  

But I’ll introduce them.



=== SONG 32: Can You Make A Mistake On Purpose? ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: JUL 2024

--- STORY ---
Transport office. Sensors, logs, timing.  
Tea break hum. She keeps typing.  
  
Kinley’s trick is a screen. Polite on the surface, built to quiet you.  
Clipboard Man watches for him.  
  
She knows that pattern.  
Three years with her father after the crash taught her where pressure hides, how shame gets used and how a particular type of person plays.  
  
This chapter sets the question.  
  
"Can you make a mistake on purpose?"  
  
No trigger yet.  
An later track will answer.  


--- LYRICS ---
I'm a little obsessive

A little intense

But only when pointed

Only when it matters

This felt like it might

  

So I got a job

Department of Transport

Traffic Systems Analyst

  

Government-grade dull

Like someone pressed copy-paste

On a thousand people

And hit send

They break for tea

I don't

They hover near the microwave

I rewrite logs

  

People say I overshare

Or undershare

Too honest

Or too hard  or too easy  to read

  

But that's what happens

When you won't run their presets

I never did the social dance

The soft shoe shuffle

Of let's not go too deep just yet

It's exhausting

Watching people try to protect

A version of themselves

They never even examined

  

So I worked

Because it's easier

To code a sensor

Than act like I didn't read

What they won't say

  

But then I had a question

Can you make a mistake

On purpose?

  

Just a little one

Can you slip something

Into the feed

And call it

A misfire?

Say a photo

On a screen

At just the right time

  

Not hacked

Not breached

Just

Misfiled

  

Human error

The most believable lie

We ever invented

  

There's this address

On the back of the card he dropped

409 Victoria Street Chatswood

Right outside the Concourse

2PM

Post-lunch crowd

Screens Cameras

Public signal access

  

I don't believe in fate

But I do believe

In tools left lying around

He's still watching me

Not daily

Not cleanly

But I catch the rhythm mid-stride

I never break pace

  

You'd think that for Kinley

It would be a private eye

A professional

A threat wrapped in black budget

But no

Just a man

A trusted hand

With a clipboard

  

Clipboard Man is

A speaker at his local church

Smiles for his community centre

Writes structural reports

Believes morality is something

You declare

  

Protests too much me thinks

And his boss's financials 

Well

I'll never say

I'll just imply

Publicly

On a screen

At 2:01 PM

In a way

Only they will recognise

Nothing illegal

Nothing traceable

Just enough

To stir their

Order

  

To answer

My question

  

Can you make

A mistake

On

Purpose?

  

Yes!


=== SONG 33: Intro to Normal?! ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: AUG 2025

--- STORY ---
Ethel Monologue cuts to the psychology of difference.  
  
Ethel isn’t built to conform or defer. Her mind moves fast. Her empathy is active, not polite. Where others soften harm to stay comfortable, she names it clearly.  
  
The intro is serious on purpose. It sets up situation with real harm and consequences. Avoidable but not avoided. The tension lives in what could have been if people didn't conform with the leash of silence.  
  
The song then explores what happens when someone wired to see consequence, refuses to play along with collective denial.  
  
In Ethel’s world, “normal” can sometimes be the camouflage that lets corruption breathe.  


--- LYRICS ---
They think everyone's the same underneath.

Like if you could get away with it 

You would.

  

Talk fast.

Push hard.

Cut corners.

Let someone else carry the mess.

  

They don't say it cruel.

They say it like fact.

Like it's just how things are.

  

Like the ones who don't play that way

Are hiding something.

  

But I've been in rooms

where that logic cost lives.

Where silence was a tactic 

And politeness, the leash.

  

So no 

I don't soft-step.

I don't let it slide.

  

If I name it early,

it's not because I'm reactive.

It's because I've seen how long

People will pretend not to know

Until someone makes them look.

  

And if that's abrasive 

Ask yourself

Who gets to call it that.

  

And who keeps calling

This

Normal.


=== SONG 34: Normal?! ===
ARTIST: Ethel
DATE: AUG 2025

--- STORY ---
She doesn’t quite fit the models. Not avoidant. Not oppositional. Not histrionic. And definitely not lacking empathy, though people tend to think that, because she doesn’t signal it the usual way.  
  
Her reactions aren’t late-stage blowups. They’re early interventions. Which makes people uncomfortable, because she names things before they’ve had time to bury them under politeness or plausible deniability.  
  
She doesn’t perform distress when it’s expected. Doesn’t conform to power to soothe discomfort. And that gets misread as cold, reactive, even aggressive.  
  
But here’s the thing. She’s often right. Not in hindsight but in real time. She sees the systems forming, where things are heading. And while most people wait until harm is too obvious to ignore Ethel doesn't. She speaks early to avoid harm that can and should be avoided and yet often isn't.  
  
This isn’t defiance. It’s moral clarity. And if it lands sharp then you may need to ask yourself why directness feels sharper than the harm that flows from inaction.  
  
Ethel’s the consequence of environments that reward denial and punish early awareness. She’s not acting out. She’s acting on what others delay.  
  
Ethel is different and sometimes that is what is needed to force a corrupt "normal" to look itself in the mirror.

--- LYRICS ---
Some built towers

I broke bonds

Reactions run cleaner

When you're not holding on

  

Didn't ice it

Didn't stir

Watched the vapor lift

No need to infer

  

They note the flame

But miss the base

They log behavior

Forget the phase

  

And me?

I buffered early

Split the curve

One side noble

One side murky

  

What looks like drift

Was calculated margin

I wasn't off

Just out of the charted garden

  

Call it noise call it flair

But I mixed truth in open air

Wrong beaker wrong flame I let it burn

Now you read the smoke and finally learn

  

Thought it cracked but it refined

The endpoint hit just out of time

So if you missed the start? Rewind

This whole thing's built to click in hindsight

  

Got flagged for ratios

They couldn't taste

Said I lacked connection

But I noted the face

  

Matched expression to intent

Before they spoke

Saw the catalyst rise

Before the joke

  

There was one

Thought I missed the cue

But I'd mirrored it back

In neutral hue

  

Ran double samples

Same reaction

One got graded

One caught traction

  

Defense ain't failure

It's a stabilizing agent

It's not a symptom

It's arrangement

Call it noise call it flair

But I mixed truth in open air

Wrong beaker wrong flame I let it burn

Now you read the smoke and finally learn

  

Thought it cracked but it refined

The endpoint hit just out of time

So if you missed the start? Rewind

This whole thing's built to click in hindsight

  

Micro-cues?

Zero slippage

I map your stance

Like lab equipment

  

Said I "might not crave the bond"

Maybe true

But I still track valence

Charge and hue

  

Yeah I titrate

What I disclose

But only cause

I know the dose

  

Call it noise call it flair

But I mixed truth in open air

Wrong beaker wrong flame I let it burn

Now you read the smoke and finally learn

  

Label me what hits your guide

But I'm the outlier that proved the slide

So next time you calibrate by type

Factor in function and hindsight

  

Yeah hindsight

It all makes sense in hindsight.

=== SONG 36: Memory Under Water ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (2022)

--- STORY ---
The imagery is delicate, but the meaning isn’t.  
  
This isn’t an elegy. It is an "autopsy of silence"'. The kind of social composure that buries people long before they die.  
  
What she is describing is her mother’s final walk. Quiet, deliberate, unseen.  
  
Isla isn’t asking for sympathy. She's confronting the inheritance of performance, the mask her mother taught her to wear “like skin.”  


--- LYRICS ---
Feels like a memory surfacing underwater

Faint, warm, unsettling

I knew the hush before the glare

The steps before the marble air

But now she stalls in winter light

Half a turn, already night

Click, a profile paper thin

A frame that will not let me in

The eyes of a mind I knew too well

Not the face, not the sound

  

Posed in frame, archived deep

A flicker no one meant to keep

Not folded warm, just kept and sent

Some headlines, record of intent

The papers lead without the crease

But silence widened, flat as seas

Filed, not false, yet not quite mine

No stitching what pains define

  

Receipts, just docket breath and forms

Fluorescent hum, bureaucrat storms

She dressed her tremor like a grace

China calm on a borrowed face

Chose men that posed like iron gates

Strong in pictures, hollow weights

Rooms would tilt, her smile would set

Gloss on glass, lights angle bent

  

The papers named me shame and wild

A headline made from someone's child

Father's house of law and glass

Clipped applause as people pass

She taught a smile to act like skin

To keep the louder truth within

I never saw her seam unspool

Only the lesson, look like rule

  

And now the columns blur and sway

Ink that warms then slips away

Their  sentences don't match our room

A kettle click, a careful gloom

The life she kept, a missing space

Was that love that couldn't stay

Or something nameless in the way

  

Logged like letters never sent

Or names in tempered glass that bent

Not legend, no, not lies but still

A story that refused to fill

She held a storm behind her eyes

Threaded neat with practiced lies

I held the mirror to the day

She turned, eyes held no gaze

  

No speeches then, just noon and stone

Heel rail slip, a mask on bone

Steady once, then down the stair

Out of frame and out of air

I stood in water colored time

Blue and slow and almost kind

And knew the question I can't cure

Was it love or was she unsure

  

I keep her absence folded small

A handkerchief behind a wall

I name the mask she taught to me

Then set it down and let it be

She took a door with no return

The quiet kind that will not learn

Signed her name and left the page

A final silence beneath her stage



=== SONG 37: The Porcelain Lie (Raise The Fourth) ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (2024)

--- STORY ---
Raise the Fourth (Porcelain Version) sits in the space between memory and possibility. Isla imagines an event that never happened but could have. She views a version of herself frozen at the edge, seeing the scene play out from both inside and above.  
  
For Isla, survival means seeing every possible ending and choosing to keep the hinge singing. Her mouth. Her voice. There are still doors ahead of her.

--- LYRICS ---
Milk glass light, chipped rim, tilt the cup, don’t drink  

Count tiles in threes, three three, then I forget, two two two  

I keep the quiet on the outside of my teeth  

I press my tongue to the crack, and hear a station hum  

  

No hymns, only doorbells with their wires crossed  

A thin white line in the glaze, look close, it’s smiling wrong  

  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing  

I’m fine, I’m fine, hear the porcelain lie

  

Glass above glass, a city inside a raindrop  

Voices turn to silver thread, then moths, then quiet ash  

Tongue numb, teeth ring, the escalator drowns politely  

I float facedown in a bowl of light, and call it prayerless  

Shiver notes climb the air, the minute hand forgets its job  

  

Nobody moves, the room moves for us  

Needle up, bright sting through bone

  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing  

Static in the molars, blue flicker in the tap water  

  

I stand inside the cold, and call it something gentle  

Count the cracks again, three three, two two two  

No answers, only handles  

If I am porcelain, strike me soft and listen  

If I am flood, put your sheet music on the surface, and read me by ripples  

  

I’ll be the misprint that makes the line unforgettable  

I’ll be the door that sings when no one’s near

  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing  

Leave the hinge singing, let the hinge sing me open


=== SONG 38: Raise The Fourth ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (2024)

--- STORY ---
Raise the Fourth opens in dissonance.  
  
Isla isn’t hiding behind metaphor. She’s tracing a moment she once imagined might end her and singing about it as if it already has.  
  
In another version, the ending floods. Here, it freezes. A still surface. Porcelain. Beneath it sits a quiet, unnerving calm, the kind that only comes from surviving something the mind has already lived through once.n.

--- LYRICS ---
Milk glass light, chipped rim, tilt the cup, don’t drink

Count tiles in threes, three three, then I forget

I keep the quiet on the outside of my mind, mind

I press my mind into a crack deep inside

No nice sounds, only layers with the wires crossed

And my thin white line, look close, it’s smiling wrong

  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

I’m fine, I’m fine, hear the porcelain lie

  

I ride cloud stairs, white sound

Tears like dry rain on brass, your notebook learns to breathe

I walk the long way round the same small square

Because circles hide the exits I can’t say out loud

  

My pulse, three three, white ash, two two two

I meet me on the offbeat, pretend it’s planned

I mouth the word open, bite the O in half

I wear a black shirt under a fluorescent storm

  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

Hold the breath, don’t spend it yet

  

Glass above glass, a city inside a raindrop

Voice turns to silver thread, then moths, then holds ash

Tongue numb, teeth ring, the rain drowns politely

I float facedown in a ball of light and call it prayerless

  

Shiver notes climb the air, the minute forgets its job

I don’t move, the room moves for me

Needle up, bright sting through bone

  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

Static in the molars, blue flicker in the tap water

  

Static in the molars, blue flicker in the tap water

Static in the molars, blue flicker in the tap water

  

Three three, two two two

No answers, only handles

If I am porcelain, strike me soft and listen

If I am flood, put your sheet music on the surface and read me by ripples

I’ll be the misprint that makes the line unforgettable

I’ll be the door that sings when no one’s near

  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

Raise the hinge, sing me open

  

Stand inside the cold and call it something gentle

Count the cracks again, three three, two two two

No answers, only handles

  

If I am porcelain, strike me soft and listen

If I am flood, put your sheet music on the surface and read me by ripples

I’ll be the misprint that makes the line unforgettable

I’ll be the door that sings when no one’s near

  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

Leave the hinge singing, let the hinge sing me open

  

Static in the molars, blue flicker in the tap water

Static in the molars, blue flicker in the tap water

  

Stand inside the cold and call it something gentle

Count the cracks again, three three, two two two

No answers, only handles

If I am porcelain, strike me soft and listen

If I am flood, put your sheet music on the surface and read me by ripples

  

I’ll be the misprint that makes the line unforgettable

I’ll be the door that sings when no one’s near

  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

Let the hinge sing, let the hinge sing me open


=== SONG 39: What You Don't See ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (2024)

--- STORY ---
What You Don’t See tells the story of what survival feels like from isla's P.O.V. Not the movie version, but the quiet kind that reshapes thought, trust, and belonging. Isla sings about growing up inside control, where love and fear spoke in the same voice, and about finding a way to step beyond it without disappearing.  
  
The song carries the pain of what was done to her, yet it isn’t about despair. It’s about repair and the reclaiming of what should have been safe all along.

--- LYRICS ---
I used to count the cracks

My mind painted from above

Thoughts branched like rivers,

None of them led out

It sat in silence,

Mind like heat

Hands like restraint

It said the world was run by those who know the rules

And me, I learnt not to cry

  

The other wore perfume like armor

It never stayed in rooms

Where feelings happened

That one called it class

While it held the mask

It gave me all I knew

It's a pressure system,

With no show

And it said I was lucky

Said I was safe

Said I lived in a house where people kept face

But I know what silence does when it learns to speak

It finds the bones

Where you buried the weak

And I never got loud

Never got seen

It said I was a bright light,

That it don’t mean a thing

You learn not to shine

When your own light burns your skin

And your smile means

Survival is a win

  

That door was closed

Not locked,

But cold

Layered in distance,

Where freedom froze

It judged from within,

The mind protects

It knots the doubt

And tightens the text

It taught me how to obey

Before I could escape

To swallow the signal

To mistrust sound

  

Not bruised outside

Not scared on skin

Just

Dressed in code

A double forked road

I knew no other

Until it fractured

And when I climbed out,

The line was cut

  

And they said I was lucky

Said I was safe

Those walls were thick

The grounds held face

  

But I know what that kind of love does to the mind

Invisible,

Surgical,

Resigned

And I never got loud

Never got peace

It said I had a mind,

Half pride, half leash

You learn not to grow

When the root’s been scorched

You learn to float

Outside your form

  

I have half its mind

That’s the inheritance

A mirror

I can’t return

But it doesn’t have my voice

That part’s still mine

Even when it trembles

Even when it breaks

  

I’ll split the fracture

Tear the frame

Keep the fire,

But forget the name

It set the match,

Just to watch me burn

But I walked through the pyre,

And never turned

There’s no wisdom in pain

No prize in the hurt

But I step past its echo,

And still plant in dirt

Something better

And this time it’s mine

  

I’ll burn the bridge

I’ll bare the nerve

Not for revenge,

But for what I deserve

I’ll take back the breath

That fear made small

And speak like it never

Owned me at all

I’ll bury the guilt

I’ll silence the myth

I’ll weaponize

What it tried to twist

Let the drums break

What it built

Let the bloodline

Witness

What I rebuilt

  

It never broke me

Just sharpened the girl

I would’ve been



=== SONG 40: What You Don't See (Symphony) ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (OCT 21, 2025 EVENT)

--- STORY ---
This is the live version of Isla's song: What you don't see. It's Isla on a piano with a Symphony Orchestra.  
  
What You Don’t See tells the story of what survival feels like from Isla's P.O.V. Not the movie version, but the quiet kind that reshapes thought, trust, and belonging. Isla sings about growing up inside control, where love and fear spoke in the same voice, and about finding a way to step beyond it without disappearing.  
  
The song carries the pain of what was done to her, yet it isn’t about despair. It’s about repair and the reclaiming of what should have been safe all along.  
  
Same lyrics as the studio version


--- LYRICS ---
I used to count the cracks

My mind painted from above

Thoughts branched like rivers,

None of them led out

It sat in silence,

Mind like heat

Hands like restraint

It said the world was run by those who know the rules

And me, I learnt not to cry

  

The other wore perfume like armor

It never stayed in rooms

Where feelings happened

That one called it class

While it held the mask

It gave me all I knew

It's a pressure system,

With no show

And it said I was lucky

Said I was safe

Said I lived in a house where people kept face

But I know what silence does when it learns to speak

It finds the bones

Where you buried the weak

And I never got loud

Never got seen

It said I was a bright light,

That it don’t mean a thing

You learn not to shine

When your own light burns your skin

And your smile means

Survival is a win

  

That door was closed

Not locked,

But cold

Layered in distance,

Where freedom froze

It judged from within,

The mind protects

It knots the doubt

And tightens the text

It taught me how to obey

Before I could escape

To swallow the signal

To mistrust sound

  

Not bruised outside

Not scared on skin

Just

Dressed in code

A double forked road

I knew no other

Until it fractured

And when I climbed out,

The line was cut

  

And they said I was lucky

Said I was safe

Those walls were thick

The grounds held face

  

But I know what that kind of love does to the mind

Invisible,

Surgical,

Resigned

And I never got loud

Never got peace

It said I had a mind,

Half pride, half leash

You learn not to grow

When the root’s been scorched

You learn to float

Outside your form

  

I have half its mind

That’s the inheritance

A mirror

I can’t return

But it doesn’t have my voice

That part’s still mine

Even when it trembles

Even when it breaks

  

I’ll split the fracture

Tear the frame

Keep the fire,

But forget the name

It set the match,

Just to watch me burn

But I walked through the pyre,

And never turned

There’s no wisdom in pain

No prize in the hurt

But I step past its echo,

And still plant in dirt

Something better

And this time it’s mine

  

I’ll burn the bridge

I’ll bare the nerve

Not for revenge,

But for what I deserve

I’ll take back the breath

That fear made small

And speak like it never

Owned me at all

I’ll bury the guilt

I’ll silence the myth

I’ll weaponize

What it tried to twist

Let the drums break

What it built

Let the bloodline

Witness

What I rebuilt

  

It never broke me

Just sharpened the girl

I would’ve been


=== SONG 41: Raise The Fourth (With Symphony) ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (OCT 21, 2025 EVENT)

--- STORY ---
Raise the Fourth (A Drop from the Fourth) is Isla at her most exposed. She's singing from that narrow edge between thought and action.  
  
The lyrics unfold like a confession in motion, describing the build-up to a suicide that never happened, told as if it did. Each line drifts between clarity and disassociation, mapping how the mind rehearses its own absence.  
  
It isn’t a song about death, but about recognizing what could have been. A the moment of seeing how close it came. Raise the Fourth is both survival and witness, sung in the tense between falling and staying.  
  
Between leaving ones self on the cutting room floor and a mouth(hinge), that just won't stop singing.  

--- LYRICS ---
Fluorescent bruise on the ceiling, hum, hum

Receipt rain on the footpath, drum, drum

We don’t use names, only handles, only doors

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

  

I run my tongue along a crack in the light

Counting wrong on purpose so the floor feels right

Three three, then two two two

The crosswalk clicks like it knows what I’ll do

  

Your paper smells like wet sandstone air

You draw a stair, I climb it nowhere

No hymns, only alarms that forgot to stop

I say open, bite the O in half and drop

  

I don’t pray,

I calibrate the static in my teeth

I don’t stay,

I lean into the turn until it speaks

  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

Bright knife, bright knife, hold, then thinning

If the door won’t answer, I’ll become the ringing

Raise the fourth, cut the room, keep the hinge singing

  

Tunnel reverb teaches my whisper to shout

Fast food clatter says in, and I choose out

Bridge ribs arch like a whale that forgot the sea

I tag each column, they forget me

  

Shoes slap puddles like bad applause

Sirens comb the air for reasonable cause

I rhyme the gutters with my under breath

Down tuned neon, quarter inch from death

  

I don’t pray,

I bargain with the meters in my bones

I won’t sway,

I keep the wrong count like a throne

  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing

Bright knife, bright knife, hold, then thinning

If the door won’t answer, I’ll become the ringing

Raise the fourth, cut the room, keep the hinge singing

  

Glass on stone, low cloud in the mouth

We stop, but the city moves south

Your finger writes melody on fogged museum skin

My skull rings once, the night rings in

  

I am the misprint that makes the line stay

I am the handle that hides the way

  

One, two, three, four

One, two, three, bar falls short

Not a crash, not a scream, just the city clearing its throat

I’m mid note, mid step, mid nothing, cut to mote

  

You’re half a street away with paper ghosts

I’m standing wrong while the quiet boasts

We rehearsed this ending without a script

All the way back when the first light tripped

  

Raise the fourth, air rips

Cut the, thin hiss

Hinge keeps, pulse, pulse

Singing

  

Time stretches thin, shows bone through skin

Pigeons walk like priests, the crowd leans in

I want to say okay, my mouth won’t lift

I offer you the rule like a final gift

  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, barely

Leave the hinge singing in the vacuum

  

If I stop, the city keeps running inside my chest

If I run, the city stands still, doing its best

What won’t resolve is the part I keep bringing,

The hinge falls sweet into ground, still singing

  

Raise the fourth

Cut the room

Hinge keeps singing

After we’re gone


=== SONG 42: Give It Back ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (2024)

--- STORY ---
Give It Back sounds like a demand, but it’s more layered than that. Isla is reaching toward the years that were never really hers. Towards the innocent kind you’re meant to have. The phrase turns over on itself in that it has a double meaning. What she's really doing is promising to return everything taken from her, only louder.  
  
Nothing in the song says it outright, yet you feel it. The stage becomes her witness box, the amps her proof. Its not an explanation but rather an answer.

--- LYRICS ---
A note at the wedge, ink still wet

A pick under boot

Red lamps fixed

I tap the grill twice

Make this cost

  

Room hire in winter, heater dead

Amp breath fogging the glass

They laid out their saints on a stand,

I wrote new words on the same mask

Marker squeaked, he watched my hand

The tall one swallowed and looked past

I cut the intro with my teeth

Downbeat hit like kicking a latch

  

Ink on the thumb, bite on the lip

Truth walks in with a split

  

Give it back, the year you pressed flat, give it back

I sing the cut, I feed it air, give it back

Salt in the mouth, iron and grit, no gloss, no patch, give it back

If you feel heat, don’t dress the mark, let it track, give it back

  

No tidy end

After school desk with a gouge near the edge

His pen crossed me out, not the text

Lemon in the hall, shoes stopped, then tests

Finish first, he said, I learned the trick

Finish small, then finish less

  

No marks on skin, just rules that bit

I sang to the sink with the tap turned up

No proof on film, the proof was shut

  

Marker in fist, jaw set to cut

Tonight that room gets brought up

Give it back, the year you pressed flat, give it back

I sing the cut, I feed it air, give it back

Salt in the mouth, iron and grit, no gloss, no patch, give it back

If you feel heat, don’t dress the mark, let it track, give it back

  

A workbook page with the margin ripped

My name in pencil, rubbed to smear

A kitchen chair with the varnish split

His shadow long, the lesson near

I mouthed a tune with my tongue stuck shut

I kept that tune, I brought it here

  

If it splits, leave it split

If it floods, let it hit

  

Put it on the wire, past paint, past dust, let it crack

Read it out, across these rigs, row by row, give it back

Seats go dark, rails go wet, we don’t mask

Read it out till glass replies, give it back

Put it on the wire, no hush, no bribe, let it track

Name by name, line by line, give it back

  

A note at the wedge, ink still wet

I step on the pick

Lights cut

We don’t patch


=== SONG 43: Don't Wake Him Yet ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (2022 · remembering AGE 15, 2016)

--- STORY ---
Don’t Wake Him Yet reaches back to when Isla was fifteen and ran away with a boy and her father’s credit card.  
  
It begins like a memory wrapped in adventure. A night flight with the glow of airports and the rush of escape. It darkens quietly, one mental image at a time.  
  
A trip that starts in rebellion ends in loss, told through the eyes of a girl who has to keep moving while the world around her stares.  
  
It’s a memory caught in time as if it only just happened. Written by someone who lived through it and can finally bear to look back.


--- LYRICS ---
Years ago

Same noise in my head

Same seats in my sleep

  

Self check in glow on your cheek

Printer coughs a narrow strip

Borrowed cap low, collar up

You say red eye, I say go

  

Duty free haze, escalator whirr

Gate glass doubles us, thin and off

Cuff mark peeks where sleeve won’t sit

I kiss that line and taste salt

  

Dog loops once by the ropes

Your palm finds pills you meant to bin

Blister cracks, you dry swallow fast

Can’t take them through, under your skin

Last call stampede, we slide that gap

  

Wheels clack seams like teeth in rows

Jet bridge breath is metal and wet

Cabin hush drops, phosphor glows

  

City grid sinks into ink

Cloud eats engines, we sink

Don’t wake him yet

Seat light fades, then sticks

He looks like rest,

  

A window star that drifts

Don’t wake him yet

We’ve got a dawn to catch

If I say his name,

The cabin air might switch

  

Seatbelt ping, cart jams mid aisle

Your grin hangs open like a cut

A vial tips, tongue takes rain

Just a sip, you say, then shut

Runway beads turn ocean to wire

Wing dips once, the rows go thin

Your eyes keep night like tinted glass

They won’t let anything in

  

I touch your arm

It doesn’t set

Crew pace past

I mouth help, help

  

Don’t wake him yet

His chest is small and still

He looks like rest,

And I’m not ready to ask

Don’t wake him yet

  

Wheels bite tarmac fast

I say his name

The row says no, too fast

  

Galley curtain lifts, then falls

PA chime hangs and won’t drop

Call lights bloom like little trials

Phones rise, mouths try to stop

Older boy under somebody’s breath

Judge’s kid drifts down the aisle

Seat map glows in emergency green

I count the clicks, file by file

  

I shake his arm, the row says no

I say his name, the day says no

  

Don’t wake him yet

Strip lights thin to glass

He looks like rest,

And I can’t push it past

Don’t wake him yet

I say his name and crack

  

He doesn’t move

I stay, I ask

Remain seated, aisle hums

I give his name, the row, the seat

  

Palm on his chest, breath to the vents

Ambos step in, I state my name, the bag, the card

They seal his jacket, I ride up front

I sign where they point, the aisle feeds

  

Headlines stick me to one word

I don’t run, I give what we did

Years back, still in my ears

  

Night gone

Noise wins


=== SONG 44: Melody of Normality ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (RECORDED 2024)

--- STORY ---
The fire on stage is real. So is the past she’s burning through. Isla’s Melody of Normality isn’t a song. It’s a reckoning — a ritual of rage sharpened by memory, fuelled by the kind of pain you don’t survive without changing. This isn’t about catharsis. This is about taking every scar and making them watch. The chaos never left. She just learned to conduct it.
--- LYRICS ---
Yeah… they know who they are...

Oh… what I would do to those from my past -

Oh…. It would not be nice.

But we turn that all into performance don't we.

Where the hell do you think it all comes from!!!

A nice little melody of normality?

Hell no!!!

Art. Is. Pain!!!!!

I bite back bile just to speak.

Choke on names, not meant to keep.
Laugh out loud, a past bent deep.

Burned the tape but looped the whispers.

Mother danced like wine on fire,

Taught me pain makes people admire.

Her nails, my skin,

just a frame to pin.

Old man? Just a last name.

A judge not judged. A family named clean.

Kept me quiet, choked then drowned.
Shattered the glass on shame-soaked ground. 
I paint in pain, then throw it wide
Etch the hands that bent my sight.

Scream my damage into form.
Hang the sound on a cruciform.

Not just to heal. This is proof. 
You can bleed…
and still find truth.

Addict lit in defensive haze,

broken edges, poetic in phrase.

Tried the needle, tried the song,

one felt right. One went wrong.

Gave her keys to court locked dirt,

passwords, patterns, pieces that hurt.

Didn’t ask her to forgive me.

Just wanted someone to finally see me.

Can’t keep me quiet. I’ll tune the scars.
I’ll turn their rooms into guitars. 
I was taught to freeze behind the door,
I’ll be the sound that cracks the floor.

Mic in hand, I’ll thread the flame.
Each note sewn with what won’t name.

This isn’t healing. This is force. 
I won't fade out.
I'll score the chorus.

It’s all still in there. 
Still breathing.
Still dressed. 
Still…
undone.


=== SONG 45: What This Was Always For ===
ARTIST: Isla
DATE: RETROSPECT (RECORDED 2024)

--- STORY ---
ISLA hits like impact and endurance colliding. It’s the first song she wrote with her new band with a sound built for distortion and defiance, with Isla’s voice cutting clean through the chaos.  
  
The lyrics reclaim what was taken from her. Strength twisted into pain. Silence mistaken for control. She turns both back on themselves. The wall becomes noise. The damage becomes feedback. It’s not just heavy, it’s confrontation made musical. A statement.


--- LYRICS ---
You built this for fists

For split lips

For broken things that don’t scream right

But not for her

Not for the one

Who stopped breathing right, but never died

  

And you called it power

All those nights in the red

But I hear what you buried

You can't hide it from this throat

  

You wrote the wall

I crack the wall

This was always waiting for me

This was never noise

It was pressure with no valve

It was a room without exits

  

You wanted loud

I bring the sound you can't outlive

You kept it hot to cauterize the memory

I breathe it back in

  

Every night

You called it rage

That’s not the word

She had a name

You never learned it

  

You wrote escape

I wear what followed

You can’t mute what this became

You thought she vanished

The girl behind the door

But she learned how to hum in ruin

  

She tuned her scars

This is not your fire now

This is not your edge now

You built the pit

But I climbed it screaming

  

I know what this was always for
