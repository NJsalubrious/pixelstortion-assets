        img: "Ethel_My_Story.jpg",
        story: `This is an overview sung by Ethel outlining the first chapter of her story.

Misread early, Ethel learned the hard way. Systems protect themselves, and people don't look until someone makes them.

When the loss of her grandparents forces Ethel to live with an estranged father, she sees the same game play out on a larger stage, built on the same rules she already experienced. But she also knows there are ways around that.

Gran left Ethel a point of contact she could trust and Isla did the rest.

Not typical. Not easy. But Ethel and Isla are neither of these.`,

        videoId: "zHWwhom80go",
        img: "Ethel_The_Drop_pr_1b__PixelStortion.jpg",
        story: `The world, for Ethel, was three colors. The deep blue of the sky, the impossible red of the desert and the living green of the forest. Home was the border between them all. Home was Gran, who was "fast in all directions," Pop, who was "grounded silence" and Ethel could just be Ethel.

It was a life of unspoken understanding. In her lab, Gran would mutter about "polymer decay" and forget her tea, goggles perched on her head. She wasn't "crazy", she just saw connections from all directions at once.

The "stock kids" wanted the moment, the film, the proof. Ethel just wanted to test their perspectives.`,

        story: `Geometry, she knew, never changes. But perspectives do. Like people with shaped lenses. And that, more than the fall itself, was what Ethel was testing.

She stood at the lip, moss soft under her toes. She wasn't guessing. Ethel was accessing the parallax, the perspective that twisted the view from below. She launched. The fall was pure physics, her arms aligned with the pull, her legs riding the line.`,

        story: `People don't see the cause. They look at reaction. It's easier that way. They track tone, not the trigger. Outcome, not the structure underneath.

Someone pushes your break line. Then acts shocked when it moves. They call you reactive. But never ask what they did before you broke surface. Dominic knows this pattern. He uses it.`,

        videoId: "2hSYNLs7w3w",
        img: "Isla_Polished_vomit.jpg",
        story: `"Polished Vomit" is Isla at a wedding she shouldn't have attended, or couldn't avoid. It's the wedding of Isla's mother and Dominic.

Why is it called "Polished Vomit"? Because that is what she calls her mother. Beautiful on the outside, but inside her mother is a mess dressed up to look like cultured stability.

This is manic Isla. But, even at her most unstable, her mind works like a cipher. Intuitive, creative, unnervingly insightful. Isla is also really good with locks.`,

        img: "Ethel_ride__PixelStortion.jpg",
        story: `"Ride" was what Ethel did when she was seventeen, across red dirt on a bike built for escape. Raised by her grandparents in rural Australia, she was already learning to weigh harm and walk her own line.

When others slipped into easy crime and tribal excuses, she stepped back quietly. The system called her "withdrawn," "non-compliant," "hostile." No one saw the choice beneath it.

When she logged into her teacher's computer and uncovered proof of his fraud, the reaction was predictable. He kept his job. She got expelled. That's where it all began.`,

        story: `The two songs "Ride" and "Gotta Move" tell a single episode of Ethel's life.

When the "stock kids" slipped into easy crime, she stepped back. The school psychologists called her "withdrawn, non-compliant." They missed her why.

So, when she saw a real systemic harm, the grant fraud at her school, she acted. The system did what systems do. It protected itself. The teacher stayed. Ethel was expelled.

Then there was a second wall. The one that ended everything. Gran and Pop were gone...`,

        story: `"I just won't break where others end." Ethel sings like she already accepted the outcome. Not dramatic. Not desperate. Just on her way.

She didn't get a real choice. Too much money in the way. Too much force wrapped around her life like it owned her.

So she made one. A mental trick in essence. She decided that this was her own decision. Because the lack of one just wouldn't feel right. No candles. No hymns. No pretty collapse.`,

Peek-A-Boo catches that first spark between them. Rivalry, recognition, and a charge that would shadow them both and tie them together, in one form or another, from here on out.`,

        story: `"I Built a Box" marks a turning point in Ethel's life, seventeen, principled, caught between choice and coercion.

Raised by her grandparents on solid ground, she knows how to resist pressure, but her father's kind of pressure is something else entirely.

So she reframed survival as a decision, a way to stay intact and eventually turn the tables on him. Her mind builds a box. A quiet set of defenses to keep her safe. It will take years to open.`,

During a convoy ambush, his men froze. Dominic ran a "Straight line", dragged the man out of the line of fire, and saved his life.

This isn't about catharsis. This is about taking every scar and making them watch. The chaos never left. She just learned to conduct it.`,
        lyrics: `Yeah… they know who they are...

Oh… what I would do to those from my past -
Oh…. It would not be nice.

But we turn that all into performance don't we.
Where the hell do you think it all comes from!!!

A nice little melody of normality?
Hell no!!!
Art. Is. Pain!!!!!

I bite back bile just to speak.
Choke on names, not meant to keep.
Laugh out loud, a past bent deep.
Burned the tape but looped the whispers.

Mother danced like wine on fire,
Taught me pain makes people admire.
Her nails, my skin, just a frame to pin.

Old man? Just a last name.
A judge not judged. A family named clean.
Kept me quiet, choked then drowned.
Shattered the glass on shame-soaked ground.

I paint in pain, then throw it wide
Etch the hands that bent my sight.
Scream my damage into form.
Hang the sound on a cruciform.

Not just to heal. This is proof.
You can bleed… and still find truth.

Addict lit in defensive haze,
broken edges, poetic in phrase.
Tried the needle, tried the song,
one felt right. One went wrong.

Gave her keys to court locked dirt,
passwords, patterns, pieces that hurt.
Didn't ask her to forgive me.
Just wanted someone to finally see me.

Can't keep me quiet. I'll tune the scars.
I'll turn their rooms into guitars.
I was taught to freeze behind the door,
I'll be the sound that cracks the floor.

Mic in hand, I'll thread the flame.
Each note sewn with what won't name.
This isn't healing. This is force.
I won't fade out. I'll score the chorus.

It's all still in there.
Still breathing.
Still dressed.
Still… undone.`

        lyrics: `You built this for fists
For split lips
For broken things that don't scream right
But not for her
Not for the one
Who stopped breathing right, but never died

And you called it power
All those nights in the red
But I hear what you buried
You can't hide it from this throat

You wrote the wall
I crack the wall
This was always waiting for me
This was never noise
It was pressure with no valve
It was a room without exits

You wanted loud
I bring the sound you can't outlive
You kept it hot to cauterize the memory
I breathe it back in

Every night
You called it rage
That's not the word
She had a name
You never learned it

You wrote escape
I wear what followed
You can't mute what this became
You thought she vanished
The girl behind the door
But she learned how to hum in ruin

She tuned her scars
This is not your fire now
This is not your edge now
You built the pit
But I climbed it screaming

I know what this was always for`
