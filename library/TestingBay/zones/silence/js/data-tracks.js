The walls are hers, though the reason why isn't spoken. Expelled from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music after a clash that no one can quite retell the same way, Isla continues pushing her musical career with a band drawn from those who saw the same fire others tried to discipline out of her.

Typical. Isla's answer isn't retreat but confrontation wrapped in humour and noise.  The song catches her mid-decision, half-laughing, half-ready to detonate and very concerned underneath it all.

She's living in a small flat in Sydney's inner west, paid for with money she'll never discuss, playing gigs that half the crowd forgets and half will never stop talking about.

It begins like a memory wrapped in adventure. A night flight with the glow of airports and the rush of escape. It darkens quietly, one mental image at a time.  A trip that starts in rebellion ends in loss, told through the eyes of a girl who has to keep moving while the world around her stares.  It's a memory caught in time as if it only just happened.

She's singing from that narrow edge between thought and action.  The lyrics unfold like a confession in motion, describing the build-up to a suicide that never happened, told as if it did. Each line drifts between clarity and disassociation, mapping how the mind rehearses its own absence.  It isn't a song about death, but about recognizing what could have been. A the moment of seeing how close it came. Raise the Fourth is both survival and witness, sung in the tense between falling and staying.

Isla is reaching toward the years that were never really hers. Towards the innocent kind you're meant to have. The phrase turns over on itself in that it has a double meaning. What she's really doing is promising to return everything taken from her, only louder.  Nothing in the song says it outright, yet you feel it. The stage becomes her witness box, the amps her proof.
