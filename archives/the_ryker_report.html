                More than a year after the audacious and deeply embarrassing escape of convicted syndicate boss Dominic
                Ryker from Long Bay Correctional Complex, a damning 3,000 word psychiatric evaluation obtained by The
                Public Record reveals that prison authorities were given explicit warnings about Ryker's "grandiose"
                self concept, high manipulative capacity, and unbroken pattern of coercive control just weeks before he
                vanished.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                The confidential report, dated February 20, 2024, paints a chilling portrait of the man the public knew
                as the "Builder," a visionary philanthropist. Instead, the forensic psychiatrist, Dr. A. R. Cole,
                describes an "intellectually capable, emotionally callous individual" with a "severe dissocial
                personality disorder" and traits consistent with clinical psychopathy.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                The document, which is published in full below, was leaked to The Public Record by a source within the
                Justice Health Network, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                The source claims the report was "buried" and that Ryker's escape was not a failure of security, but a
                "systemic failure of perception."
            </p>

            <div class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gray-900 italic text-gray-700 mb-8">
                "The public, the courts, and eventually, corrections staff, all bought the myth," the source stated.
                "They were all so dazzled by the 'hero complex' they couldn't see the 'calm menace.' This report proves
                they knew. They had it in writing. And he still got away."

            <h3 class="font-sans-ui font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-8">The "Builder" Myth vs. The "Mask"</h3>

            <p class="mb-6">
                For years, Dominic Ryker was a media darling, celebrated for his "visionary drive" and philanthropic
                contributions. His 2023 trial, which exposed his criminal empire, was largely framed as a tragic "fall
                from grace," a good man corrupted.
            </p>

            <figure class="float-right ml-6 w-1/2 mb-4">
                <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/723d75_cfc4d40a47a840cdb7735ffa80ec01ee~mv2.jpg"

                    The Mask: Ryker's public persona as the benevolent "Builder."
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Dr. Cole’s report argues the "good man" was never there.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                The evaluation notes that Ryker's insight was "minimal and highly externalized," describing his vast
                criminal enterprise as "structural correction" and "a necessary service."
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Ryker's "hero complex," the report states, "appears to be a core, fixed belief" that provides "a moral
                alibi for his antisocial and exploitative actions." When confronted with the harm he caused, Ryker
                expressed only "cognitive remorse" (acknowledging "it's a shame people were hurt") rather than
                "affective remorse" (feeling any actual guilt or empathy).
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                "He reframes his convictions as a 'failure of perspective' on the part of the court," Dr. Cole writes,
                quoting Ryker directly from an interview: "Heroes don't confess it. They just let you believe. That's
                the service."
            </p>

            <div class="clear-right"></div>

            <h3 class="font-sans-ui font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-8">"The Same Breath": A Pattern of Control</h3>

            <p class="mb-6">
                The report details how Ryker's "calm menace" was his primary tool. It references court testimony (the
                "Same Breath" incident) where Ryker rescued a man during an ambush in Italy, only to personally execute
                him hours later for "freezing."
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Dr. Cole notes the rescue and the execution were "spoken of with the same flat, calm affect."
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                This pattern, the report reveals, continued inside Long Bay.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                A "Key Observation" section details how Ryker was already "mentoring" a younger, vulnerable inmate,
                following a "clear grooming pattern." Staff observed Ryker providing protection and "calm advice,"
                framing dominance as "safety."
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                He was overheard telling the inmate: "Structure helps. Rules save time. Obedience clears space. You will
                rest."
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                The report chillingly concludes that this was "a clear rehearsal of his methods of establishing control
                via manufactured dependency."
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-sans-ui font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-8">A System "Charmed"</h3>

            <p class="mb-6">
                The report's final risk formulation assessed Ryker's risk for impulsive violence as "low." But it
                assessed his risk for planned, instrumental, and coercive harm as "VERY HIGH."
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Dr. Cole's summary opinion, written just weeks before the escape, is a stark warning.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                "He remains a significant risk," the report concludes. "The primary risk is not embedded in rage but in
                rhythm. the measured, calm cadence of a man who genuinely believes that order is something only he can,
                and should, enforce."
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                This is the man who, a month later, leveraged that same "calm cadence" and "instrumental" planning to
                simply walk out of a maximum security prison.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                "The public perception was wrong because Dominic charmed them," the whistleblower said. "This report
                proves the system was charmed, too. He told them exactly who he was. They just didn't want to believe
                it."

                <span class="font-bold">Speech:</span> Paced, measured, and deliberate. Prosody is flat, with low vocal
                variance.<br>
                <span class="font-bold">Affect:</span> Constricted and superficial. He performs rapport well, using
                superficial charm, but affect appears instrumental. that is, mobilized for effect rather than genuinely
                felt.<br>
                <span class="font-bold">Thought:</span> Coherent and goal directed. No evidence of psychosis, paranoia,
                or formal thought disorder.<br>
                <span class="font-bold">Insight:</span> Insight into his offending is minimal and highly externalized.
                He describes his criminal enterprise as "structural correction" and "a necessary service." He expresses
                only cognitive remorse (i.e., "It's a shame people were hurt") rather than affective remorse (i.e.,
                feeling guilt or empathy for those he harmed).
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                He is cooperative but guarded, frequently steering conversation to his own personal philosophy, which is
                highly grandiose. He stated, "The hand that acts first is the hand remembered. Pause too long, and you
                vanish." He reframes his convictions as a "failure of perspective" on the part of the court, stating,
                "Heroes don't confess it. They just let you believe. That's the service." This "hero complex" appears to
                be a core, fixed belief.

            <h4 class="font-bold underline mb-2">4. PSYCHOSOCIAL HISTORY & CUSTODIAL BEHAVIOUR</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Mr. Ryker's history as a high profile developer and philanthropist (his "public mask") is well
                documented. This persona stands in stark contrast to the instrumental violence, coercive control, and
                calculated criminality detailed in court transcripts.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                <span class="font-bold">Pre Custodial Behaviour:</span> A consistent pattern of rationalizing harm as
                "instructional." When discussing a violent incident in Italy (per court files), he reframed the
                execution of an associate as a "leadership decision," stating the man "froze" and became a "liability."
                The rescue and the execution are spoken of with the same flat, calm affect (the "Same Breath" phenomenon
                noted in PSR).
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                <span class="font-bold">Custodial Behaviour:</span> Mr. Ryker has incurred no disciplinary infractions
                for direct violence. However, unit staff note he has established a position of significant informal
                authority.

                <span class="font-bold">Key Observation:</span> He has been observed "mentoring" a younger, more
                impressionable inmate (Ref:[REDACTED]). This relationship appears to follow a clear grooming pattern
                consistent with his pre custodial M.O.:
                <br>1. Isolation & Trust: Providing protection, commissary items, and "calm" advice.
                <br>2. Coercive Benevolence: Framing this control as "safety" and "structure." Staff overheard him
                telling the inmate: "Structure helps. Rules save time. Obedience clears space. You will rest."
                <br>3. Binding: Assigning small, then significant, tasks that test loyalty and create dependency.

            <h4 class="font-bold underline mb-2">5. PERSONALITY FORMULATION</h4>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Mr. Ryker's presentation is highly consistent with a severe personality disorder.
                <br><br>
                <span class="font-bold">Dominant Features:</span> Pathological narcissism, grandiosity, entitlement, and
                a profound lack of empathy.
                <br><br>
                <span class="font-bold">Psychopathy Constructs (PCL R):</span> He strongly endorses traits for Factor 1
                (Interpersonal/Affective), including superficial charm, a grandiose sense of self worth, and an absence
                of guilt. His "calm menace" and instrumental (planned, emotionless) use of violence are hallmarks. PCL R
                screening estimate places him in the 30 32/40 range, meeting the diagnostic threshold for psychopathy.
                <br><br>
                <span class="font-bold">Cognitive Style:</span> He does not break rules , he rewrites them to fit his
                narrative. His "hero complex" is a total cognitive framework that provides a moral alibi for his
                antisocial and exploitative actions.
            </p>

            <h4 class="font-bold underline mb-2">6. RISK FORMULATION (HCR 20 v3 Narrative)</h4>
            <p class="mb-6">
                <span class="font-bold">Historical (H):</span> Risk is HIGH. His history is one of chronic, severe, and
                versatile antisocial conduct, including instrumental violence, high level fraud, and manipulation of
                legal/corporate systems.
                <br><span class="font-bold">Clinical (C):</span> Risk is HIGH. He remains affectively stable,
                insightless, and highly narcissistic. His attempts to groom a fellow inmate are a direct clinical risk
                factor for future harm. His "calm" state is not a mitigating factor , it facilitates his planned,
                coercive conduct.
                <br><span class="font-bold">Risk Management (R):</span> Risk is HIGH. Subject is intellectually intact
                and presents a significant risk for the covert manipulation of peers and conditioning of staff.
                <br><span class="font-bold">Triggers:</span> Loss of influence, perceived "disrespect," or challenges to
                his grandiose self concept.
                <br><br>
                <span class="font-bold border-b border-black">Summary of Risk:</span> Risk for impulsive, reactive
                violence is assessed as low. Risk for planned, instrumental, and coercive harm (psychological,
                financial, and physical) remains VERY HIGH.

            <h4 class="font-bold underline mb-2">8. MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS</h4>
            <p class="mb-6">
                9. Environment: Continued placement in a maximum security setting is required.<br>
                10. Staffing: Given high manipulative capacity, rotate unit staff frequently to mitigate conditioning
                effects. All staff must be briefed on his M.O. of using "benevolence" and "favors" to establish
                control.<br>
                11. Vulnerable Inmates: The inmate (Ref:[REDACTED]) currently being "mentored" by Mr. Ryker should be
                moved to a different unit immediately, citing nonspecific "cellblock reorganization."<br>
                12. Intervention: Mr. Ryker is assessed as a poor candidate for insight oriented therapy. He is a high
                risk candidate for dominating and corrupting unstructured group therapy. Recommend individual, CBT based
                "Reasoning & Rehabilitation" (R&R) modules, focusing purely on accountability and consequential
                thinking.<br>
                13. Monitoring: All communications (mail, telephone) must be monitored for coded language or attempts to
                direct external operations.
            </p>

            <h4 class="font-bold underline mb-2">11. SUMMARY OPINION</h4>
            <p class="mb-8">
                Mr. Ryker is an intellectually capable, emotionally callous individual whose core identity is anchored
                in being necessary and in control. His "hero complex" is a deeply rooted, grandiose defence for a severe
                dissocial personality disorder.
                <br><br>
                He remains a significant risk to the community and to the good order of the facility. The primary risk
                is not embedded in rage but in rhythm. the measured, calm cadence of a man who genuinely believes that
                order is something only he can, and should, enforce.
