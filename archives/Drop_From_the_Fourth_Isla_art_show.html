        <article class="lg:col-span-7 prose prose-xl prose-p:font-light prose-headings:font-art max-w-none">

            <p class="lead text-2xl font-medium mb-8">
                Before meeting her, I knew Isla the way most Australians do. As the impossible metal vocalist whose
                voice filled stadiums, broke charts, and spawned think pieces about “female rage in the 21st century.”
            </p>

            <p>
                But walking into <strong>Drop From the Fourth</strong>, her first visual art exhibition, I realised
                something quickly. I knew almost nothing about her.
            </p>

            <p>
                The work on the walls was intelligent, deliberate, technically vicious. No chaos. No cliché. No wildness
                except the kind you get from someone who survived long enough to sculpt their own story.
            </p>

            <p>
                So when Isla approached quietly, composed, dark eyed and dry mouthed, I realised my art world
                assumptions were showing. And worse. She noticed.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl mt-12 mb-6 uppercase">An awkward beginning</h2>

            <p>
                She found me staring too long at a large triptych of blurred faces pressed against a smeared surface,
                human forms distorted through thick oil and palette-knife abrasions.
            </p>

            <p>
                I said something academic about “performative alienation.” She raised an eyebrow.
            </p>

            <div class="pull-quote">
                “Or maybe it’s just three people who didn’t like the artist.”
            </div>

            <p>
                There it was. The tension. Not hostile. Not combative. Just Isla’s way of saying. <em>Don’t
                    intellectualise me before you’ve met me.</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                She gestured to the painting.
            </p>

            <p class="font-bold italic">
                “It’s called Burning Bridges. People think it’s about anger. It’s about leaving too late.”
            </p>

            <p>
                For a moment, I understood precisely how far off the mark my assumptions had been.
            </p>

            <p>
                The deeper we moved into the gallery, the more contradictory Isla became. Her reputation suggests
                volatility. The woman in front of me was restrained. Her humour wasn’t loud. it was surgical.
            </p>

            <p>
                She noticed me scanning her work for familiar narrative patterns.
            </p>

            <p class="font-bold">“You’re looking for trauma in the shape of a guitar solo.”</p>

            <p>I started to apologise. She shook her head.</p>

            <div class="bg-black text-white p-8 font-art text-xl italic my-8">
                “It’s fine. I know the brand they stuck me with. But I’m not drunk, I’m not self destructive. Not today.
                And I’m not a walking cautionary tale. I’m just a person with a lot of feelings I refuse to pretend are
                nice.”
            </div>

            <p>
                That was the first moment I felt the shift. She wasn’t dangerous. She was honest. And honesty is
                unsettling in a way chaos never is.

                <p class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg">
                    We reached a smaller room where a painting showed Isla’s face worn down by abrasions, oil dragged
                    until ten expressions lived in one surface.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg">
                    I like to ask a certain question to all artists. What do they think of AI. The hate if fairly
                    consistent. Isla was direct.

            <p>She continued:</p>
            <p class="italic">"In the mean time we've got systems that mimic us.. but there will be people making
                amazing art with it soon. The oddballs. The early adopters."</p>
            <p>She stepped closer to the painting.</p>
            <p><strong>“But slop? People can't differentiate slop from art when its new and different. Sure - those
                    messy, misaligned outputs everyone mocks? Its slop.”</strong></p>
            <p>A subtle smile.</p>
            <p class="text-3xl font-art font-bold">“Slop is compost in the right hands.”</p>

            <p class="mt-8">Then, more pointedly:</p>
            <p>“People call my early music trauma spew. Too ugly. Too raw. Not polished. It was called slop. But I knew
                it wasn't. And my art isn't for everyone. Some people need to hate it. That's part of the art form. My
                art isn’t meant to soothe. It’s meant to relay what the world refuses to acknowledge.”</p>

            <p>I told her that sounded harsher than most artists allow themselves to admit. She replied softly:</p>

            <div class="border p-8 text-center my-12 bg-white">
                <p class="font-art text-xl">“If you witness something terrible and then go back to work the next day and
                    everyone pretends the world didn’t just split open inside you? That silence is the trauma. I make
                    things for the people who live in that silence.”</p>
            </div>

            <p>And with that, the tension between us dissolved, not because she convinced me, but because she revealed
                the version of herself that fame obscured.</p>
