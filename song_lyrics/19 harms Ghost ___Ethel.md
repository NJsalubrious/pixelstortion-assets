## Song Description

Harm’s Ghost pulls you inside Ethel’s head, into the space between instinct and restraint.  
  
She sees what others either miss or refuse to confront out of fear or uncertainty.  
  
It isn’t about fear or control. It’s about the moment people see harm coming, know it can be stopped, and still choose to stay quiet.

## Lyrics

It's not belief, it's balance

It's not doubt, it's damage

It's not panic, it's pattern

I move with consequence managed

  

You say I'm certain?

I'm not I'm close

I just act when I know the harm's ghost

  

You think I'm wrong?

I might be

But if I'm off?, I shift quietly

  

I rewind convos like film with a fault

Not from fear, I'm just running the vault

  

Don't make noise

Don't cut through

Don't raise hands when the rule book's blue

  

Maybe they didn't mean harm…

So why's my gut flex like it ate an alarm?

  

Maybe it couldn't be foreseen

Then why's my brain flash red on the scene? 

  

"You're dramatic"

"You overreact"

Read that line in a thousand acts

  

No, I'm not your fear on legs

I just know what happens when no one checks

  

If I see pain comin'

And I freeze for peace?

That's not restraint, that's a moral breach

  

I know the codes

I know the acts

I've done the script dressed in tact

  

Wore safe words

Wore "balanced" tones

Wore "measured" masks that weren't my own

  

Survival shape 

But not my shape

Cut those ropes when the line got fake

  

It's not belief , it's balance

It's not doubt, it's damage

It's not panic, it's pattern

I move with consequence managed

  

You say I'm certain?

I'm not I'm close

I just act when I know the harm's ghost

  

You think I'm wrong?

I might be

But if I'm off?, I shift quietly

  

Justice ain't slow for social ease

It's sorting moves you don't believe

  

Clarity don't need your nod

It shows up sharp and never soft

  

Some move fast 'cause doubt delays

They bank on fear to clear their plays

  

So while you're paused

Weighing shame

They're three steps in

Rewriting names

  

Me? I move

When the damage is nil

If I get it wrong

I pay that bill

  

Wrong fast

Own it

Adjust

But I won't let harm in

just 'cause it looks just

I don't think binary

I read terrain

Signals gaps

And tight domain

  

I see who flexes

Who ducks the frame

Who leaves silence

And plays the game

  

If I'm right 

You're safe tonight

If I'm wrong 

I realign right

  

But I won't fold

For the crowd's appeal

They taught me "pause"

Means "ignore what's real"

  

I learned that fear's

got fancy clothes

But it's still a muzzle

When courage shows

  

And no 

I'm not on the sell

I just spot the burn

Before it swells

  

It's not faith, it's reflex

It's not hunch, it's math and mess

It's not rage, it's read and risk

It's not wrong to move like this

  

You say I'm sharp?

You're not wrong

I track where silence drags too long

  

You think I'm off?

Possibly

But I don't sit still where harm could be

  

Call it instinct

Call it grace

Call it action

That holds its place

  

Certainty's cousin  

Not its clone

I move when the stakes

Cut straight to bone

  

It gives me ground

Lets me speak

Lets me draw that

sharp technique

  

But I won't live in it

It's not my truth

Just a way to move

With a jagged proof

  

If you need it?

You're off the mark

Fast moves

But in the dark

  

Too late to shift

Too far gone

That's not me

  

I'm still on
