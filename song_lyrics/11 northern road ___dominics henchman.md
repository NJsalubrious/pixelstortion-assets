## Song Description

This event shows Dominic Ryker's terrifying capacity for compartmentalization.  
  
While maintaining a carefully fashioned facade in Sydney as a successful developer and philanthropist, Dominic is simultaneously running a global, violent empire. This song, "Same Breath", details an incident that occurred on the "Northern road" in Italy. We aren't told the underlying details.  
  
Here is what we know.  
  
During a convoy ambush, his men froze. Dominic, in an act of apparent heroism, ran a "Straight line", dragged the man out of the line of fire, and saved his life.  
  
"Later," after the threat was neutralized, he executed the same man. The execution served as a brutal message to the rest of his crew.  
  
Don't freeze. Don't stop. If you do you'll end up like this man.  
  
The song highlights the chilling reality witnessed by his henchman. This was a "Hero. Killer. Same step".

## Lyrics

Northern road.

Stone walls.

Convoy steady.

  

Driver’s head burst.

Sound came late.

Echo rolled in slow.

  

Dominic slid him down.

Hands on the wheel.

No pause.

Just drove.

  

He drove.

He never stopped.

He drove.

He never stopped.

  

Trucks ripped.

Steel torn out.

Men erased in seconds.

  

One crawling near the trees.

Ground naked.

No cover.

Dominic ran.

Straight line.

Grabbed him by the belt.

Dragged him in.

No one else moved.

  

Same breath.

Same man.

One pulled back.

One never came.

  

He slipped to the tree line.

Silent.

Minutes stretched like years.

  

Then ground tore open.

Truck lifted.

Another flipped.

Burning.

  

Dominic walked back.

Step by step.

Checked each wreck.

Cleared them all.

  

Same breath!

Same man!

Dragged alive!

Cut down!

  

Later. Smoke gone.

Police paid.

Ground quiet.

  

He spoke low

to the man he saved.

Then he dropped.

Casual.

Gone.

  

Dominic walked past.

Didn’t look back.

  

Still warm.

Eyes wide.

Thought the talk was still on.

  

Same breath! SAME BREATH!

Same man! SAME MAN!

One dragged alive! DRAGGED ALIVE!

One cut down! CUT DOWN!

  

I was there.

I saw both.

Hero.

  

Killer.

Same step.
