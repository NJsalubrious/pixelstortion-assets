## Song Description

The world, for Ethel, was three colors. The deep blue of the sky, the impossible red of the desert and the living green of the forest. Home was the border between them all. Home was Gran, who was "fast in all directions," Pop, who was "grounded silence" and Ethel could just be Ethel.  
  
It was a life of unspoken understanding. A "thanks" was never needed for a new bike chain, just as an "I love you" was never needed to feel the "unspoken alliance of minds" she shared with Gran. They just knew .  
  
In her lab, Gran would mutter about "polymer decay" and forget her tea, goggles perched on her head. She wasn't "crazy", she just saw connections from all directions at once. And in that "fast" way of seeing, she saw Ethel perfectly.  
  
Ethel rode the fence line, just because. She wasn't like the "stock kids" with their "big boots, big bikes, bigger land." She wasn't interested in riding gates or fences . She was interested in the "weird pixel on satellite" that shouldn't have been there. The "bend in the earth" she found herself.  
  
It wasn't a cliff, not exactly. It was a twenty meter drop into a basin wrapped in green, a place where one wrong step would mean not landing straight, or at least that is how it looked.  
  
The "stock kids" wanted the moment, the film, the proof. Ethel just wanted to test their perspectives.

## Lyrics

Where the desert meets the forest

Red

Blue

Home

  

Gran left the gate open

She always does

Bike's warm

Pop moved it

Didn't say anything

  

Tyre's rotated

Chain cleaned

I didn't do it

  

No need to say thanks

They know

I know

  

Gran will be in her lab by now

Window open

Goggles on her head

Talking to herself

About polymer decay

And forgetting her tea again

She's not crazy

Just fast in all directions

I ride the fence line straight

They're ahead

Three of them

Stock kids

Big boots Big bikes

Bigger land

  

They ride gates and fences

I ride

Just because

Fifteen K out

Five K in

No tracks marked

Just a weird pixel on satellite

where there shouldn't have been

  

Didn't even look like a fall

But it was

Canopy snaps shut

Track tightens

Ferns stretch over the trail

Air shifts  heavy now

  

One more turn

And we'll see it

I found it last year

Kept it to myself for a while

  

It's not a cliff 

not exactly

It's a bend in the earth

where the stone curves out

drops twenty meters

into a basin wrapped in green

  

Water falls like glass

If the light's right

One wrong step

And you won't land straight

  

But if you do

They're filming

They want the dive

They want the moment

  

I don't say where from

I just stop!

They know what that means

Here we go!
