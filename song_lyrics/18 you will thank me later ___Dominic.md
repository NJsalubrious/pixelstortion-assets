## Song Description

In the cold, structured walls of prison, Dominic finds his next project. His new cellmate. Not with a show of force. Not with threats. But with a calm voice in a room where the loud have already lost.  
  
This is Dominic’s song: A calm, rhythmic guide to turning trust into currency, and a willing man into a spent resource.  
  
Step 1: Remove doubt.  
Step 2: Remove choice without them noticing. Keep your voice even. Match their rhythm.  
  
Step 3: Give them something harmless to do  
Step 4: Give them something important to do  
Step 4: Finally give them something they can’t take back.  
  
Never rush. Never ask twice.  
  
By the time they see the pattern, you’re already holding the ending.

## Lyrics

Not every door is meant to open.

Not every weight is yours to lift.

Is really yours.

  

But that's good.

That's safety.

That's why I'm here.

  

Tired?

Of guessing.

Of watching.

Of wondering.

  

I get that.

Structure helps.

Rules save time.

Obedience clears space.

Why hold burdens

That I already know

How to carry?

  

Just...

Follow clean.

You'll see.

  

You will rest.

(You will.)

  

You will see.

(You will.)

  

You will let go.

(You will.)

  

You will need me.

(You will.)

  

Anger burns fast.

Noise burns faster.

Plans?

They cloud.

  

But rhythm?

That's power.

  

I don't shout.

I don't clash.

  

I hold steady.

While others thin out.

  

Stay near.

Stay easy.

  

I build.

You borrow.

  

That's how you win.

That's how I win.

  

Look around.

See them rush?

See them grasp?

  

Soon they'll ask me.

Not because they lost.

Because they want to stop losing.

  

Smart, really.

Better to lean

than be left.

  

You will rest.

(You will.)

  

You will see.

(You will.)

  

You will let go.

(You will.)

  

You will need me.

(You will.)

  

No need to run.

No need to reach.

No need to doubt.

  

You already decided.

You already asked.

You just didn't

know it.

  

But that's why

you'll thank me later.
