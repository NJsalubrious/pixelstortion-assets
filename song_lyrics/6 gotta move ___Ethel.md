## Song Description

The two songs "Ride" and "Gotta Move" tell a single episode of Ethel's life and the video sows them back to back.  
  
When the "stock kids" slipped into easy crime, she stepped back. The school psychologists called her "withdrawn, non-compliant."  
  
They missed her why. She didn't just see the act (a stolen wallet). Ethel's hyper-empathy modeled the emotional harm to the victim. "I just see the mirror behind the stunt And who cops the hit when the fun runs blunt."  
  
So, when she saw a real systemic harm, the grant fraud at her school taking money directly from kids that need it the most, she acted. She "slid the Admin lane" and opened a file with the wrong name.  
  
The system did what systems do. It protected itself. The teacher stayed. Ethel was expelled. This was Ethel's first significant "wall".  
  
Then there was a second wall. The one that ended everything. Gran and Pop were gone...

## Lyrics

The silence is the warning

They said,

We've made arrangements.

I said,

You didn't ask.

They said

You're under eighteen.

I felt the room sink.

With loaded dice.

Gran's key's still in my palm.

Bent at the teeth.

They didn't ask how it happened.

Didn't ask what I saw in the glass.

The social worker said my name like a question.

I didn't answer.

Just looked at the file

with the staples missing.

  

Don't need to yell.

Just count the exits.

I know how many hands

Are behind this.

  

You don't place me.

You pass me.

I let you smile

Because you don't see it.

Too clean.

  

Found a name in the court logs.

Redacted

Sure.

But there's shape in omission.

Weight in silence.

No date.

No detail.

But a pattern built itself in the gaps.

One woman said,

This doesn't feel right.

She's gone.

  

Not scared.

Not small.

Just…

Aware.

  

Control isn't always loud.

Sometimes

It wears a suit

And hands you tea.

  

I don't run.

I adjust.

I track the angle of the knife

Before it shines.

You didn't plan for that.

  

You don't place me.

You pass me.

I let you smile

Because you don't see it.

Too clean.

  

I don't run.

I adjust.

I track the angle of the knife

before it shines.

You didn't plan for that.

  

You don't place me.

You pass me.

I let you smile

Because you don't see it.

Too clean.
