## Song Description

The trial’s done. He’s where he belongs. She’s finished what she started. Now comes the quiet part. The part left after.  
  
Ethel's name is still in the headlines. Her face is still tied to his. Work’s meant to follow study, but nothing lands. Maybe that’s coincidence, maybe not.  
  
The song is about what remains when one dramatic story ends and movement is all that’s left. Ethel doesn't want to be turned into his echo or his correction.  

## Lyrics

They gave him a room with a lock and steel

Gave me a road with no fixed wheels

He's got a bed four walls a name

I've got streetlights that forget the same

  

He counts his days in rising dust

I count my steps past places I trust

He's got a view that never shifts

I trade mine every time I  cross borders

  

Don't hang your hopes on some slow star

Don't carve my name where your heroes are

I'm no sparrow caught mid-flight

I break clean I hold no light

  

They said I wore the noise too thin

Took no trophies took no spin

But I just needed ground that stayed

Not walls that begged to be repaid

I don't trace maps  I crack the floor

I don't weave back  I mark the door

If it hollows I let it through

If it stumbles I don't undo

  

Don't hang your hopes on some slow star

Don't carve my name where your heroes are

I'm no sparrow caught mid-flight

I break clean I hold no light

  

They said I wore the noise too thin

Took no trophies took no spin

But I just needed ground that stayed

Not walls that begged to be repaid

  

I don't trace maps  I crack the floor

I don't weave back  I mark the door

If it hollows I let it through

If it stumbles I don't undo

  

Don't hang your hopes on some slow star

Don't carve my name where your heroes are

I'm no sparrow caught mid-flight

I break clean I hold no light

  

If I look slow I'm counting cracks

If I sound gone I'm marking tracks

Every tilt each hollow thread

Where old maps call the living dead

  

So I fixed the wire not the frame

Moved the mark where no hands claim

Stacked their wrecks outside the night

So no one else rewrites that fight

I don't wear grief like soft designs

I ride the noise and call the signs

And when it hums when it cuts clean

I keep the thread outside unseen

And when it hums when it cuts clean

I keep the thread outside unseen
