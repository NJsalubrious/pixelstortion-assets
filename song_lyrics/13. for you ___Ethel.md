## Song Description

Ethel yells the verdict: “You made a cage. FOR YOU!!!!!".  
  
This track holds all the tension of that three year window spent in her estranged fathers world. The gaslight fog. The psychological shell game.  
  
The man who came to kill her one evening....  
  
Silence isn't free and so this track is loud. Its Heavy Metal.

## Lyrics

Quiet isn't peace

Silence isn't free

I know what this is

This is you

Inside my mind

Inside of my mind

Rearranging my mind

  

Words tighten

Wire in my throat

I nod

I kneel

No

My mind would choke

Teeth behind glass

They smile too wide

Guilt pours sweet,

While they break my mind

You chose this

You built this

Liar

  

This isn't care

This isn't kind

This is a cage

Made for my mind

This is the hand

That feeds while it feeds

On me

  

Build a cage

Fell it age

Jail's coming

Hold fear in

Repeat your wins

Until believed

Tough and real

That's why you steal

Can't hurt me

Won't look good

Not in prison

Soap and cooks

  

Big man

Underneath

In between

Covered up

Sealed shut

  

You sell me comfort

While pulling threads

Wrap me quiet

I file anger

To a calm point instead

Breath turns blade

Still, you whisper,

  

You're afraid

I was

But this isn't fear

This is seeing

  

You call it loyalty

You call it blood

But you showed me

What you are

  

This isn't your win

This isn't your spin

This is where

I begin

  

Grind me down

You can't erase me

  

No safety here

No way to mend

What defends

With what lies so bent

Just breath and burn

Just scream and learn

I was blind

I see you turn

  

Build a cage

Build it new

Jail's here

Not for me

Repeat your wins

Nobody hears

Tough and real

Sucks to be you

Can't hurt me

You're locked down

I'm not in prison

We're not the same

Big man

In the dark

Out of reach

Sealed tight

Lost sight

  

I saw it

I see it

You made a cage

  

For you!!
