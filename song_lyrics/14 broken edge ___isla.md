## Song Description

When Ethel met Isla, she met a mind that runs on both chaos and intellect.  
  
Dominic misread her. People don’t usually burn the bridge they’re standing on.  
  
Bet she won’t?  
You lose.  

## Lyrics

Numbers whispered, walls so thin

Keys inside the lines

Let chaos win

  

A phone, a pet, her hidden name

One more shot, no rules, just game

Locked away, my mind's my cage

I've burnt before, today's my stage

They call it manic, they name the sin

But clarity cracks when pain breaks in

  

Spent and spun, won't mend, can't hide

A knife edge truth, I'm split inside

Glass mirrors, echoes, screams

Sanity stutters between the seams

  

Dominic's hook, a golden trap

Money glittered, tasted flat

Eighty blown, predictable haze

But clarity cuts in my darkest phase

One hundred down on truth untamed

Shadows filmed, sins unnamed

I boxed it tight, a ticking clock

Her name whispered, key to the lock

  

Spent and spun, won't mend, can't hide

A knife edge truth, I'm split inside

Glass mirrors, echoes, screams

Sanity stutters between the seams

  

Biker flames from digital ink

Burning bridges, didn't think

The man who comes, the man who warns

My mind splits open, reality scorns

Schizophrenic whispers, borderline sway

Brilliant madness lighting my way

I'm not evil

I'm not fine

Chaos spun design is mine

  

A barroom fury, whiskey sharp

Scattered bottles, broken harp

Words like bullets, truths like glass

My laughter bitter as moments pass

Dominic's mistake, saw simple vice

But twisted edges aren't so nice

I'll burn us both, no price too steep

Clarity lives where madness sleeps

  

Spent and spun, won't mend, can't hide

A knife edge truth, I'm split inside

Glass mirrors, echoes, screams

Sanity stutters between the seams

  

I'm the fracture in perfect lies

A broken edge that won't disguise
