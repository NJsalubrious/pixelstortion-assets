## Song Description

The song sits at the start of a trial that’s been years coming.  
  
Dominic’s myth is crumbling in real time and Ethel’s not here to mourn it.  

## Lyrics

They called him Builder.

Protector.

Said he got things done.

Broke some eggs?

That was the phrase.

Omelette on the table, 

Never mind who hit the floor first.

They said he saved me once.

Stopped a man inches away.

But no one asked

Why the man was there at all.

Builder! Protector! 

Hero! Killer!

Every wall he raised,  

Someone buried under.

Builder! 

Hero! Killer!

Applause is the cover,

But the cracks keep showing.

  

Killer instinct.

Visionary drive.

Sounds fine

When you’re safe in the seats.

I’ve seen it up close.

Instinct cuts.

Drive leaves marks.

Vision carves out the body.

  

Builder! Protector! 

Hero! Killer!

Every wall he raised, 

Someone buried under.

Builder! 

Hero! Killer!

The silence pays the bill,

And the crowd just claps along.

I've got the same refusal to back down.

Difference is, 

I don’t turn it on the unarmed,  

With proof in silence and bodies!

  

Builder! Protector! 

Hero! Killer!

Every wall he raised, 

Someone buried under.

Builder! 

Hero! Killer!

Applause hides the blood,

But the cracks keep showing.

  

Some call it alpha.

Some call it ruthless.

I call it cost, 

Paid by someone else,

Never by the one clapping.

Applause hides it.

Headlines dress it.

But silence, 

Silence keeps the debt alive.

  

Builder! Protector! 

Hero! Killer!

Every wall he raised, 

Someone buried under.

Builder! 

Hero! Killer!

No applause can smother, 

The cracks keep showing.

  

So call him, 

Builder! Protector! Hero!

But don’t act surprised

When the missing people

Were part of the design.

Hero!

Killer!
