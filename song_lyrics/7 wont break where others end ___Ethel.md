## Song Description

'I just won’t break where others end.'  
  
Ethel sings like she already accepted the outcome.  
Not dramatic. Not desperate.  
Just on her way.  
  
She didn’t get a real choice.  
Too much money in the way.  
Too much force wrapped around her life like it owned her.  
  
So she made one. A mental trick in essence.  
She decided that this was her own decision.  
Because the lack of one just wouldn’t feel right.  
  
No candles.  
No hymns.  
No pretty collapse.

## Lyrics

Didn't cry when they told me

Just kicked the stand down slow

Police at the gate boots on gravel

They didn't know what I now know

Gran said life don't wait for clean hands

Pop said fix it if it squeaks

So I stripped my brakes that morning

Found her code in the teeth beneath

  

Don't light a candle don't play that hymn

Don't speak in lines they wrote for them

I know the way I know the bend

I just won't break where others end

  

Red drops back Blue takes hold

Cabin hums with edges bold

I said stop  but meant I can't

Too deep in to shift or plant

Exit signs I don't believe

I Know too much

Not enough for me

Could name the truth

Could change the scene

But can't block out what runs unseen

A fight I feel but can't defend

Not with three turns past pretend

No road back I'd trust to try

Not if my X can solve the Y

  

Don't light a candle Don't frame my face

Don't say I drifted out of place

I'm not the tears they try to fake

I'm what they build when something breaks

  

He talks

I track the tone

Eyes flick side

I scan alone

Rear view

Same car same space

Not slow

Not close

Just… placed

Could be a tail

But the driver's fine

One of his

Feels by design

We turn

The house arrives too soon

Like it leaned out to read the room

Windows set

Sharp Reflective

Gate peels back like something elective

Helmet

Bike

Too smooth

Too known

That's a gift

That's a loan

Still  I lift it

Still  I ride

Not for noise

But I came to try

Might not win

But I won't hide

  

  

Don't light a candle

Don't name regret

Don't say I

Failed what I hadn't met

If I move close if I play right

It's not surrender

It's just the night

  

The city's lit like fevered skin

A pulse that breaks draws back again

Headlights slice in broken time

Reflecting truths I can't align

Each street a question half unsaid

A choice not mine

A path misread

Windows flicker

Counting slow

What secrets keep

What shadows know

Chrome steals fragments

Gran's soft laugh

Pop's silence mapped across the path

Sky pulled thin

A stretched disguise

Like tension held behind its eyes

My grip tightens

Throttle breathes

Red turns green; the engine seethes

Traffic signals mark the gaps

In all the truths that slipped the traps

The city hushes

Holds its breath

Pavement hums like whispered death

I don't slow

I don't explain

This is decision

Because the lack of one

Just wouldn't feel right
