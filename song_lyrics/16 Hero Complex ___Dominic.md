## Song Description

Dominic sells himself as the steady one who moves when others freeze. In practice he waits, watches who hesitates, then steps in so people remember the move and forget the pause. It is control dressed as calm.  
  
Rescue buys loyalty. Favors turn into a tab.  
  
Violence, when he uses it, feels routine. He smiles, people relax, but their gut still tightens. They want to believe him. The song puts that pull beside the unease and the contradictions, so the shine and the damage sit in the same light.

## Lyrics

Show me a man who never missed,

And I’ll show you one

Who never moved.

Show me the one who froze,

And I’ll show you

The first to fall.

  

The hand that acts first

Is the hand remembered.

Pause too long,

And you vanish.

They’ll call it reckless.

They always do.

Then later they’ll say

It saved them.

  

I hold steady. I hold steady.

When the storm breaks. I don’t move.

When the crowd runs. I don’t move.

Not above you. Not above you.

Not beside you. Not beside you.

Right where the silence

Turns the tide.

  

We hold steady. We hold steady.

We keep rhythm. We keep rhythm.

We take burden. We take burden.

So the world won’t break apart.

Not above you. Not above you.

Not beside you. Not beside you.

We are the weight,

We are the hand,

We are the silence

That turns the tide.

  

I steadied one once,

Pulled him back.

They named it brave.

Another time,

I didn’t.

Same hand, same breath.

The room still clapped.

  

Every tower stands

On something buried.

Every oath

Draws from blood unseen.

Heroes don’t confess it.

They just let you believe.

That’s the service.

  

Still in every phrase like a shadow.

We hold steady. We hold steady.

We keep rhythm. We keep rhythm.

So the world won’t fall apart.

  

Decisions don’t wait.

That’s why they’re mine.

And one day

You’ll thank me

For not asking.
