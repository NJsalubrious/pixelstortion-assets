## Song Description

"I Built a Box" marks a turning point in Ethel’s life, seventeen, principled, caught between choice and coercion.  
  
Raised by her grandparents on solid ground, she knows how to resist pressure, but her father’s kind of pressure is something else entirely.  
  
So she reframed survival as a decision, a way to stay intact and eventually turn the tables on him.  
  
The song follows her first uneasy steps into his world, where control feels like safety and survival begins to blur with complicity.  
  
Her mind builds a box. A quiet set of defenses to keep her safe.  
It will take years to open.

## Lyrics

He said

Just until you're steady

And it felt like sense

Because I wanted it to

They gave me a room with no dust

An ocean that doesn't move

A kitchen with nothing burned

And knives so beautiful

You forget they're sharp

She laughs like glass breaking in reverse

Says things that float but never land

I let it pass

She's not the test

  

He tells me things with just a look

How hard it's been How much he's done

For Isla For Us For me

The house nods in agreement

Like it's heard the story before

I wanted to believe it for a minute

To pretend I was trading one thing

For something real

To pretend I was sharp enough to catch the line

Before I crossed it

  

I signed the form

I used my card

I pinned it

He said it was sorted

Bail's expensive

Isla needed help

The link said refund

The account said

Mine always had

You'd do the same

Wouldn't you?

Wouldn't you?

  

It was one night

Just food

Just a deal

Just a moment

But a man came looking

Not loud Not rushed

He smiled

Like a receipt

And then

He was gone

Like someone

Pressed delete

  

No cops No claims

Just silence

Where a person had stood

And me

Watching my own hands

As if they'd done it

Knowing they hadn't

But knowing

He knew

I'd think they had

  

I built the box

And walked right in

Dressed it with justifications

Hung my guilt

Where the mirror should've been

It smelled like home

So I let it stand

Buying time

But I see my mind a little blind now

  

I built the box

And walked right in

Dressed it with justifications

Hung my guilt

Where the mirror should've been

  

It smelled like home

So I let it stand

Buying time

But I see my mind a little blind now
