## Song Description

Transport office. Sensors, logs, timing.  
Tea break hum. She keeps typing.  
  
Kinley’s trick is a screen. Polite on the surface, built to quiet you.  
Clipboard Man watches for him.  
  
She knows that pattern.  
Three years with her father after the crash taught her where pressure hides, how shame gets used and how a particular type of person plays.  
  
This chapter sets the question.  
  
"Can you make a mistake on purpose?"  
  
No trigger yet.  
An later track will answer.  

## Lyrics

I'm a little obsessive

A little intense

But only when pointed

Only when it matters

This felt like it might

  

So I got a job

Department of Transport

Traffic Systems Analyst

  

Government-grade dull

Like someone pressed copy-paste

On a thousand people

And hit send

They break for tea

I don't

They hover near the microwave

I rewrite logs

  

People say I overshare

Or undershare

Too honest

Or too hard  or too easy  to read

  

But that's what happens

When you won't run their presets

I never did the social dance

The soft shoe shuffle

Of let's not go too deep just yet

It's exhausting

Watching people try to protect

A version of themselves

They never even examined

  

So I worked

Because it's easier

To code a sensor

Than act like I didn't read

What they won't say

  

But then I had a question

Can you make a mistake

On purpose?

  

Just a little one

Can you slip something

Into the feed

And call it

A misfire?

Say a photo

On a screen

At just the right time

  

Not hacked

Not breached

Just

Misfiled

  

Human error

The most believable lie

We ever invented

  

There's this address

On the back of the card he dropped

409 Victoria Street Chatswood

Right outside the Concourse

2PM

Post-lunch crowd

Screens Cameras

Public signal access

  

I don't believe in fate

But I do believe

In tools left lying around

He's still watching me

Not daily

Not cleanly

But I catch the rhythm mid-stride

I never break pace

  

You'd think that for Kinley

It would be a private eye

A professional

A threat wrapped in black budget

But no

Just a man

A trusted hand

With a clipboard

  

Clipboard Man is

A speaker at his local church

Smiles for his community centre

Writes structural reports

Believes morality is something

You declare

  

Protests too much me thinks

And his boss's financials 

Well

I'll never say

I'll just imply

Publicly

On a screen

At 2:01 PM

In a way

Only they will recognise

Nothing illegal

Nothing traceable

Just enough

To stir their

Order

  

To answer

My question

  

Can you make

A mistake

On

Purpose?

  

Yes!
