## Song Description

Shiny Headed Radio Man is Isla Unleashed. Raw, furious, and done with the gatekeepers.  
  
All she wants is the audition the band promised, but the man holding the door treats access like currency. Sleaze wrapped in influence. Isla gives him exactly what he fears. No compliance. No charm. No apology.  
  
The song spirals between humor and confrontation, performance and real anger. It’s the sound of a woman refusing to barter her worth for permission, turning a power imbalance into a public reckoning, one scream at a time.  

## Lyrics

Radio host  

Studio room  

Not shiny like his head  

Radio bad boy yaps crap, nose sniff, mirror hum  

Same deeeeal  

Door creaks  

Eyes wide  

I screeeeeaaammmaarrooohhaarrrrrr  

Walls peel  

Assistant pokes her head in  

More eyes  

Good  

Best if he’s  

Frightened  

Shiny boy looks  

Disturbed

  

Am I a girl?  

Am I?  

How do you know?  

I’m not  

No, I am  

But do you know?  

Do they want a girl  

Or a boy?  

The dead singer band  

Bring back the bad boy  

They can’t  

He’s dead

  

Maybe I’m a bad boy  

I can sound like a man  

Are you a man?  

Shiny head man  

A persistent man  

Learn the sentence

  

No  

No  

No  

No no no  

Fuck you no  

You have bat rabies  

Just take me to the fucking band  

  

Ozzy bat rabies  

Any spare bats?  

I’m the new crazy  

You need me  

’Cause they need me  

Shiny head rabies man  

Wants to give me babies  

Shiny head babies  

Just take me to the band  

Not happening  

Shiny head man  

Just take me to the band

  

I’m a man  

You’re a man  

Not gonna happen  

Shiny head man  

Money, money  

Crap trap cash man  

Know the band?  

I know what you want  

Fuck you shiny head man  

Just take me to the band

  

They want me  

They need me  

I’m dirt layered on nitrate  

You’re just dirt  

Just get me the fucking audition  

You’ll be happy  

They need my vocal sledge

  

I’m not biting the head off your fucking bat
