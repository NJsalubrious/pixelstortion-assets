## Song Description

"Clipboard Man" unfolds like a quiet chase told in reverse. Ethel knows clipboard man isn’t her threat. He’s a signal. A reflection. He's part of a larger thing that needs eyes and ears for its own protection.  
  
When surveillance starts to fold back on itself, she sets her own decoy in motion. She hires a private investigator as a second set of eyes. A moving mirror.  
  
What follows is assessment without panic. Hotels, side streets, small cues that build into proof. Kinley’s people are tracking Ethel but Ethel is also tracking them.

## Lyrics

He's not my threat

He's my reflection

If they're watching him

they're reading my direction

He's not their man

He's in my plan

  

Up before noon

Shared kitchen tension

No conversation

just the sound of someone

wondering where I go that early

No plan

Just distance

Ten k inbound

Dash light cold

Mirror clean

Motor warm

  

Didn't brief the PI

Didn't name the threat

Said just enough to make it legal

Said little enough to keep it useful

He logs my loop

But the trick isn't what he sees

It's who sees him

If they trace him?

They'll find a real license

Real pay

Real reason

Not their reason

Mine

  

Side street

Black bike

Kickstand soft

Four Seasons

Kinley 1:10

Exit cue

different tie

same woman

I walked in

Slight glance

Just filed it

Not scandal

Just routine

He doesn't see me

Not really

But he feels it

That flick in the spine

When something's been logged

  

Split at the fountain

I peeled right

Bike just ahead

And parked nearby

Clipboard

Not flashy

Not branded

Grey beard

Thinning hair

Didn't write

Didn't read

Just… carried it

That's when I named him

Not "the man"

Not "the tail"

Clipboard Man

  

He's not my threat

He's my reflection

If they're watching him

They're reading my direction

He's not their man

He's in my plan

And that's why

I named him:

Clipboard Man

  

Back on the bike

Rocks behind me

Harbour bridge ahead

Kinley stlyed south

  

I didn't

Wind sharp

Mirrors steady

Clipboard tailing

  

Two cars back

Low gear wrong lane

But rhythm matched

That's not coincidence

That's rehearsal

  

I cut north

Didn't rush

Just broke line of sight

In the turn

He slowed

Didn't stop

Didn't search

My guy kept with him

Just back one set

Let the rhythm reset

Clipboard rolled into

A side-industrial patch

  

Not sketchy

Just not coffee

Stayed parked

Fifteen minutes

Glove box lean

Phone glance

No call

  

Then:

A bag from the passenger side

Not groceries

Just enough

To get logged

  

My PI stayed on him

Not close

Not loud

Just long enough

To make it seem

Coincidental

Clipboard cut east

Didn't call

Silver sedan

Front seat

No plates worth logging

Ten minutes later:

Warehouse block

  

Quiet

Not quiet-quiet

Just "extra"

Not illegal

Just… indicative

  

He's not my threat

He's my reflection

If they're watching him

They're reading my direction

He's not their man

He's in my plan

And that's why

I named him:

Clipboard Man
