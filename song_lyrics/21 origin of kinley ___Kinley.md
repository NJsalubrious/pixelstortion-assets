## Song Description

In the void left after Dominic there are new contenders. Kinsley is best seen as the system embodied. A presence that cannot be beaten. Only endured or outmaneuvered. Where Ethel seeks clarity, Kinsley deals in optics, leverage, and survival politics.  
  
Kinley is the handler archetype, polished, professional, polite on the surface, but always calculating.  

## Lyrics

A phrase I say playbook rehearsed

Mental tone same zone same verse

Seems it came from my family's good line

But I bent and split it with a political spine

They all got brains polished degrees that's fine

Wasn't chasing praise just a visible bloodline

And when my storm rolled in dead quiet

No words hit the mark no one tried it

  

Guilt money Guilt money

Target drawn my inner pact

Didn't know couldn't act

And here I come with paper stacks

Plans I wrote fine-tuned with time

Too late for truth just political spine

  

Thirty years the clock was wound

Held me off and held me down

Learnt from falls played it straight

Walked through walls called it political fate

Hard to see me if you want to trust

Hard to break through my charm and rust

But time reveals even though brief

Occasional cracks in my self-belief

  

Guilt money Guilt money

Bullseye lit in legalese

If it sticks I split no fees

No one looking no one sees

It's all too twisted for simple minds

So they shrug it off call it fine

  

Felt nothing for the man who died

He cut me slow and smiled wide

Million marks to contain his flame

  

They rode the wave never took the blame

Moved it quick behind closed walls

Made the call or I'd lose it all

No remorse no time to stall

Just get it done and watch him fall

  

Guilt money Guilt money

You don't speak you just agree

If you see me I'll make you bleed

And when you do it's a relentless feed

I'll tie you in knots with rotten string

I'll just smile and not say a thing

  

Guilt money Guilt money

Let it hit let you rot

It's not about what could've been

It's just about what you are not

Guilt money Guilt money

Let the first word burn
