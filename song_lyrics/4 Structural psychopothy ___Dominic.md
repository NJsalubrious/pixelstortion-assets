[intro]
People don't see the cause
They look at reaction
It's easier that way

They track tone
Not the trigger
Outcome
Not the structure underneath

Someone pushes your break line
Then acts shocked when it moves
[verse]
They call you reactive
But never ask what they did
Before you broke surface

I have seen it everywhere
In every planning room in this city

Someone wants a shortcut
And someone else wants a scapegoat

And I feel it
I feel it happening to you

You were too tired
Exactly where they wanted you

See how they spun it
One outburst
And your history
Becomes the headline

That planner did not want clarity
He wanted control of the narrative
And he got it

Too exhausted
To defend the frame
They built around you

Let me show you the real pattern
[chorus]
They rewrite you when they can't read you
They flag your tone not the contact
They spin your story into their version
Then step back
I watched it land
I tracked it through
I don't let it go
Because intent cuts true
[verse]
So let's sit
Let's talk

Your hands are trembling
Your emails stack unread
The ceiling of this project
You are holding it alone

And they think you are having a moment
Of course they do
Here you are at midnight
Fixing their mistake

With the soil report contradicting itself
For the third time

I see you arguing
For safer footings
But getting drowned out
By cost consultants
Who have never had sign off
On anything more than an agreement

Let's be practical
One rod is ideal
Rigor is ideal

But the schedule is bleeding out

And rigor does not help
When the bank will not extend the loan
And the panel meets in eight days

When the builder walks out

Projects this size
Live by adjustments
Not ideals

Two rods
Offset the load
Same result
Faster install
Cheaper labour

Eighteen to twenty four months
Back in your pocket

Your life back in your pocket

You can go home
You can sleep

Just say yes
Or don't say anything at all

If you want it to be
It can be
[chorus]
They rewrite you when they can't read you
They flag your tone not the contact
They turn your story into their version
Then step back
I watched it land
I tracked it through
I won't not let it slide
Because intent cuts true
[verse]
It is over engineered
It is structurally sound
You know it is

You're' exhausted

Let the project breathe
Let yourself breathe

You can go home
You can turn off your phone
Spend time with your kids
Spend time with your wife

That sounds good does it not
Yeah
[chorus]
I'll rewrite your story when they can't read you
I'll set your tone so they won't believe you
I'll shape truths story into my version
Then step back
I'll watched it land
I'll tracked it through
I'll let you be
What I need you to be
[outro - ramped up power and orchestral metal. Ends ominously]
Sydney
Late afternoon
The steel let go

Like a small earthquake
One
Two
Then another
The fourth floor hit the third
The third hit the second
The second hit the floor

The headline is written
Looking at you

It was just you
Just you
Just you
Just you

Just you
