## Song Description

Situation - ethel is still working in data - but now for a research lab. maybe they didnt realise how easily she could pick up what was happening  - she understood patholody and genetics - rna, dna.. snips - yada yada she followed the latest developments in  retime pcr and looked closley at the graphe this company rolled out and the way they shut people up when they couldnt replicate the data - their data. . the data was clear - it wasn't real data - it was fake data. human trials were about to start. people would die. not straight away and not with an obvious link but that just made it worse. 



Ethel Monologue cuts to the psychology of difference.  
  
Ethel isn’t built to conform or defer. Her mind moves fast. Her empathy is active, not polite. Where others soften harm to stay comfortable, she names it clearly.  
  
The intro is serious on purpose. It sets up situation with real harm and consequences. Avoidable but not avoided. The tension lives in what could have been if people didn't conform with the leash of silence.  
  
The song then explores what happens when someone wired to see consequence, refuses to play along with collective denial.  
  
In Ethel’s world, “normal” can sometimes be the camouflage that lets corruption breathe.  

## Lyrics

They think everyone's the same underneath.

Like if you could get away with it 

You would.

  

Talk fast.

Push hard.

Cut corners.

Let someone else carry the mess.

  

They don't say it cruel.

They say it like fact.

Like it's just how things are.

  

Like the ones who don't play that way

Are hiding something.

  

But I've been in rooms

where that logic cost lives.

Where silence was a tactic 

And politeness, the leash.

  

So no 

I don't soft-step.

I don't let it slide.

  

If I name it early,

it's not because I'm reactive.

It's because I've seen how long

People will pretend not to know

Until someone makes them look.

  

And if that's abrasive 

Ask yourself

Who gets to call it that.

  

And who keeps calling

This

Normal.
