## Song Description

This song marks the night Isla burned Dominc's bridge to freedom. The song is part revenge, part release.  
  
Mara Quinn, Senior Reporter at "The Southern objective" would later write:  
  
"Start with the documents. Their path into court isn’t a heist narrative. It’s procedure.  
  
Sources close to the matter say Isla, derided as “the addict girl” by commentators who haven’t read a brief, first surfaced material that pointed to long running patterns,  
  
Circular payments through shell entities, land assemblies that moved like chess, and external contractors whose invoices tracked neatly with campaign seasons. None of that becomes evidence until law enforcement recreates the trail. That’s what happened. Officers did the slow part. Warrants, images of drives, chain of custody. The songs and the spectacle are a sideshow. The documents are not."

## Lyrics

He bought me out in needles.

Found my dealer, stacked it high.

Last good time’s on me.

Like it made him noble.

Like my death was proof he cared.

I said thank you.

Like it was dinner.

Like he’d done me a favor.

Five men, front steps, watching glass.

I smiled through it ,  calm, steady.

Then slammed the teeth of the house back shut.

Steel psychos flip.

Shadows left in the dark.

You’ll be alright out there.

Wait a while.

He’ll be back.

No he won’t!

Fists on doors.

Phones useless.

Five tough men small outside.

  

Inside, my hands ran the system.

Every click mine.

Every lock theirs.

Nice to meet you.

Now die in the cold.

  

I walked his rooms.

Drives pulled one by one.

Empire bleeding in my hands.

Black boxes heavy as sins.

  

Funny, really.

He thought overdose was a gift.

But this?

This is mine back.

Exit unseen.

The hole only he and the builder knew.

Now me.

Steps fading.

Breath gone.

  

Bridge burned!
