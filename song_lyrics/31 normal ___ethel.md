## Song Description
Ethel is say this: hey - you want to say im breaking bonds? what because I wanted to save the lives of people taking medication they keeps you employed? fin but please consider - function (iq) complicates the issue because I'm seeing things you don't and I see things your mind wants to bury and gloss over and hide from you. Im an outlier. I'm not normal. but.. not in the way you think. 


She doesn’t quite fit the models. Not avoidant. Not oppositional. Not histrionic. And definitely not lacking empathy, though people tend to think that, because she doesn’t signal it the usual way.  
  
Her reactions aren’t late-stage blowups. They’re early interventions. Which makes people uncomfortable, because she names things before they’ve had time to bury them under politeness or plausible deniability.  
  
She doesn’t perform distress when it’s expected. Doesn’t conform to power to soothe discomfort. And that gets misread as cold, reactive, even aggressive.  
  
But here’s the thing. She’s often right. Not in hindsight but in real time. She sees the systems forming, where things are heading. And while most people wait until harm is too obvious to ignore Ethel doesn't. She speaks early to avoid harm that can and should be avoided and yet often isn't.  
  
This isn’t defiance. It’s moral clarity. And if it lands sharp then you may need to ask yourself why directness feels sharper than the harm that flows from inaction.  
  
Ethel’s the consequence of environments that reward denial and punish early awareness. She’s not acting out. She’s acting on what others delay.  
  
Ethel is different and sometimes that is what is needed to force a corrupt "normal" to look itself in the mirror.

## Lyrics

Some built towers

I broke bonds

Reactions run cleaner

When you're not holding on

  

Didn't ice it

Didn't stir

Watched the vapor lift

No need to infer

  

They note the flame

But miss the base

They log behavior

Forget the phase

  

And me?

I buffered early

Split the curve

One side noble

One side murky

  

What looks like drift

Was calculated margin

I wasn't off

Just out of the charted garden

  

Call it noise call it flair

But I mixed truth in open air

Wrong beaker wrong flame I let it burn

Now you read the smoke and finally learn

  

Thought it cracked but it refined

The endpoint hit just out of time

So if you missed the start? Rewind

This whole thing's built to click in hindsight

  

Got flagged for ratios

They couldn't taste

Said I lacked connection

But I noted the face

  

Matched expression to intent

Before they spoke

Saw the catalyst rise

Before the joke

  

There was one

Thought I missed the cue

But I'd mirrored it back

In neutral hue

  

Ran double samples

Same reaction

One got graded

One caught traction

  

Defense ain't failure

It's a stabilizing agent

It's not a symptom

It's arrangement

Call it noise call it flair

But I mixed truth in open air

Wrong beaker wrong flame I let it burn

Now you read the smoke and finally learn

  

Thought it cracked but it refined

The endpoint hit just out of time

So if you missed the start? Rewind

This whole thing's built to click in hindsight

  

Micro-cues?

Zero slippage

I map your stance

Like lab equipment

  

Said I "might not crave the bond"

Maybe true

But I still track valence

Charge and hue

  

Yeah I titrate

What I disclose

But only cause

I know the dose

  

Call it noise call it flair

But I mixed truth in open air

Wrong beaker wrong flame I let it burn

Now you read the smoke and finally learn

  

Label me what hits your guide

But I'm the outlier that proved the slide

So next time you calibrate by type

Factor in function and hindsight

  

Yeah hindsight

It all makes sense in hindsight.
