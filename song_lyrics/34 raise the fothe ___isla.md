## Song Description

Raise the Fourth (Porcelain Version) sits in the space between memory and possibility. Isla imagines an event that never happened but could have. She views a version of herself frozen at the edge, seeing the scene play out from both inside and above.  
  
For Isla, survival means seeing every possible ending and choosing to keep the hinge singing. Her mouth. Her voice. There are still doors ahead of her.

## Lyrics

Milk glass light, chipped rim, tilt the cup, don’t drink  

Count tiles in threes, three three, then I forget, two two two  

I keep the quiet on the outside of my teeth  

I press my tongue to the crack, and hear a station hum  

  

No hymns, only doorbells with their wires crossed  

A thin white line in the glaze, look close, it’s smiling wrong  

  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing  

I’m fine, I’m fine, hear the porcelain lie

  

Glass above glass, a city inside a raindrop  

Voices turn to silver thread, then moths, then quiet ash  

Tongue numb, teeth ring, the escalator drowns politely  

I float facedown in a bowl of light, and call it prayerless  

Shiver notes climb the air, the minute hand forgets its job  

  

Nobody moves, the room moves for us  

Needle up, bright sting through bone

  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing  

Static in the molars, blue flicker in the tap water  

  

I stand inside the cold, and call it something gentle  

Count the cracks again, three three, two two two  

No answers, only handles  

If I am porcelain, strike me soft and listen  

If I am flood, put your sheet music on the surface, and read me by ripples  

  

I’ll be the misprint that makes the line unforgettable  

I’ll be the door that sings when no one’s near

  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing  

Raise the fourth, cut the room, leave the hinge singing  

Leave the hinge singing, let the hinge sing me open
