## Song Description

The intro song to "Shiny headed Man" sets the stage for what comes next.  
  
She’s chasing an audition that could change everything, but the man who promised to open the door expects payment that isn’t music. Typical. Isla’s answer isn’t retreat but confrontation wrapped in humour and noise.  
  
The song catches her mid-decision, half-laughing, half-ready to detonate and very concerned underneath it all. She knows his type all to well.  
  
If the bridge burns, so be it. She’ll build her own stage from the ashes and make it louder.

## Lyrics

He’s sleazy as fucckkkk  

Yeah but he knows the band  

Do I need him?  

We don't need  

What’s he gonna do?  

Same as he’s done before  

But,  

It’s,  

Twenty,  

Twenty,  

Five?  

Yeah,  

Some are still around  

So?  

So?

  

We frighten the shit out of him  

And we prove we should be in the band

  

He’s a sleezy chimp headed man  

That’s rude  

But true  

So if we burn the bridge  

Then we do what we always do

  

We frighten the shit out of him  

And we prove we should be in the band

  

And if the bridge is burnt  

Fuck it,  

Let’s just be me  

Yeah,  

Frighten the fuck out of him  

Still concerning  

Just make noise Isla
