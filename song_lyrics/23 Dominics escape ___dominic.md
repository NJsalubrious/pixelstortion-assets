## Song Description

Dominic understands the average person the way others read instructions. He learned by testing limits others never would, the kind that press on the meeting point of empathy, reason, and self-interest.  
  
Most people stop there. Dominic doesn’t. He watches for random mistakes, sometimes a reaction to the pressure he applies, sometimes pure chance. It makes no difference.  
  
Dominic notices the needs, the mistakes, the misplaced trust, the small openings people leave, and he exploits them fearlessly and without hesitation.

## Lyrics

Tray lands

She taps once

Doesn't meet my eye

That's better

  

Cuffs presented

I extend the wrists

She tightens one

Leaves the other convenient

  

He nods

Doesn't verify

They never do

If your rhythm matches their system

  

One buzz

Latch hums

Shoes on tile

Same song New verse

  

Pen clicks

Clipboard lifts

She adjusts posture 

Small things that say belief

  

He watches her

I watch him

His gaze drags just a little late

That's where I live

  

No suspicion

Just pacing

If you speak in rhythm

People stop hearing what you say

  

I give them space

They fill it in

Call it certainty

Call it gut

I call it mine

  

I don't lie

I sequence

They don't check

They complete

  

One omission

Two suggestions

You think you thought it

That's enough

  

No walls hold what I can thin

No chains bind what slides within

You follow codes

I reroute signs

Game's not won 

Until I decide

  

She says "We've met"

I glance sideways

She writes the meeting into memory

Smiles like it always happened

  

He opens a path

No one told him to

That's the best kind of obedience 

The kind that feels like instinct

  

I never gave a name

But she recalls one

Wasn't mine

Still it works

  

Call it charm

Call it misdirection

I call it removal

Of friction Of doubt

  

A gesture lands

A glance misreads

They build the rest

I walk inside it

  

Their logic fills the holes I leave

I don't raise alarms

I just set the tempo

  

No walls hold what I can thin

No chains bind what slides within

You check corners

I check keys

Game's not done 

Not 'til I leave

  

Doing okay?

He asks

I shift my eyes 

Not fast Not loud

  

He turns

Predictable

  

She lifts the form

Eyes snag on a name

Something off 

But not enough

  

You'd be amazed

How many crimes

Are made possible

By courtesy

  

Door opens

Air moves

Paper flicks

  

They remember sound

But not shape

Not me

  

Gone isn't a moment

It's a series of permissions

No one knew they gave

  

No walls hold what I can thin

No chains bind what slides within

You check corners

I check keys

Game's not done 

Not 'til I leave

  

They'll count the exits

Check the footage

Make the calls

  

They won't find me

Not yet
