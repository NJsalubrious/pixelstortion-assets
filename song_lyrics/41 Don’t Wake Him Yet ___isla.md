## Song Description

Don’t Wake Him Yet reaches back to when Isla was fifteen and ran away with a boy and her father’s credit card.  
  
It begins like a memory wrapped in adventure. A night flight with the glow of airports and the rush of escape. It darkens quietly, one mental image at a time.  
  
A trip that starts in rebellion ends in loss, told through the eyes of a girl who has to keep moving while the world around her stares.  
  
It’s a memory caught in time as if it only just happened. Written by someone who lived through it and can finally bear to look back.

## Lyrics

Years ago

Same noise in my head

Same seats in my sleep

  

Self check in glow on your cheek

Printer coughs a narrow strip

Borrowed cap low, collar up

You say red eye, I say go

  

Duty free haze, escalator whirr

Gate glass doubles us, thin and off

Cuff mark peeks where sleeve won’t sit

I kiss that line and taste salt

  

Dog loops once by the ropes

Your palm finds pills you meant to bin

Blister cracks, you dry swallow fast

Can’t take them through, under your skin

Last call stampede, we slide that gap

  

Wheels clack seams like teeth in rows

Jet bridge breath is metal and wet

Cabin hush drops, phosphor glows

  

City grid sinks into ink

Cloud eats engines, we sink

Don’t wake him yet

Seat light fades, then sticks

He looks like rest,

  

A window star that drifts

Don’t wake him yet

We’ve got a dawn to catch

If I say his name,

The cabin air might switch

  

Seatbelt ping, cart jams mid aisle

Your grin hangs open like a cut

A vial tips, tongue takes rain

Just a sip, you say, then shut

Runway beads turn ocean to wire

Wing dips once, the rows go thin

Your eyes keep night like tinted glass

They won’t let anything in

  

I touch your arm

It doesn’t set

Crew pace past

I mouth help, help

  

Don’t wake him yet

His chest is small and still

He looks like rest,

And I’m not ready to ask

Don’t wake him yet

  

Wheels bite tarmac fast

I say his name

The row says no, too fast

  

Galley curtain lifts, then falls

PA chime hangs and won’t drop

Call lights bloom like little trials

Phones rise, mouths try to stop

Older boy under somebody’s breath

Judge’s kid drifts down the aisle

Seat map glows in emergency green

I count the clicks, file by file

  

I shake his arm, the row says no

I say his name, the day says no

  

Don’t wake him yet

Strip lights thin to glass

He looks like rest,

And I can’t push it past

Don’t wake him yet

I say his name and crack

  

He doesn’t move

I stay, I ask

Remain seated, aisle hums

I give his name, the row, the seat

  

Palm on his chest, breath to the vents

Ambos step in, I state my name, the bag, the card

They seal his jacket, I ride up front

I sign where they point, the aisle feeds

  

Headlines stick me to one word

I don’t run, I give what we did

Years back, still in my ears

  

Night gone

Noise wins
