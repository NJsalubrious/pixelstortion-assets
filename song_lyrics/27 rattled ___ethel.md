## Song Description

"Rattled" unfolds through the voice of Detective “Sticky,” a man who spots trouble faster than protocol allows. He’s sharp, impatient, allergic to small talk, and just self-aware enough to know it. When Ethel crosses his path, he recognises the type. Too bright. Too direct. Too unwilling to wait for systems that crawl.  
  
The song becomes their collision point. He sees her drive and the potential danger in it. The way she mirrors her old man’s edge without meaning to. It isn’t a warning aimed to hurt or out of pity. Its actually a helping hand born from experience.  
  
Sticky knows what happens when conviction moves too faster and when small jabs get a reaction. He can just tell that someone’s going to test that.  
  
Sticky has an abrasive style that is weirdly kind and compassionate. He's best seen as a very kind stoic man who has experienced it all and seen it all before and often speaks truth not to hurt but to help - like training ones immune system for a later encounter. With Ethel he sees a strong young women with enormous potential who is also bruised, justice sensitive and doesn't see some of her weak spots that others, like Kinley, will see and use and so he pokes them as a way to prepare Ethel rather than hurt. He also sees a part of her that might be prone to over correcting injustice and going too far if the right set of circumstances arise.

## Lyrics

Some things you don't chase.

You let'em run.

Trail the echoes.

Wait for the turn.

  

They sent me a file.

Couple of lines. 

Flagged.

Interference. 

Pressure.

Name.

Kinley.

Not again. Another one.

Complaint retracted next morning

Told me all I needed.

They don't retract 'cause it's fine.

They retract when clout and teeth work.

  

  

Then came her. Too sure.

Frayed order.

Parts I'd never seen put together like that.

Redhead.

Eyes like she sees the tech behind your head.

Came at me.

USB and a mission.

Didn't ask. Didn't wait.

Like the world was wrong

when it should be right.

I thought: Another Smart, Dumb kid.

Mistaking instinct for rule.

So I looked her up.

Holy #$%!!

  

The Daughter of...

Dominic Ryker.

Everyone remembers that trial.

She was what

Seventeen?

Put that #$% inside.

On that stand. Alone. Five months.

Seasoned cops break from that. She didn't.

Did it with that pointed look.

Testified like someone who knew.

  

Alright. Not a kid. Not soft.

Not bluffing...

But.. interfering.

  

  

And now...

Oh #%^&.

She took a government job.

Systems analyst.

I laughed. 

Jesus

Here we go.

Playing Kinley's game

back on itself.

Access. Fast pulse. Impulse posed

In red.

Funny. But not.

She's not stable. Not yet.

No anchor. Just velocity.

Hope that brain sees itself.

Dangerous

Even to allies.

She sees. She acts.

But the law doesn't move like her pulse.

And that guy? Kinley?

He doesn't get caught like that.

He chokes you with procedure.

Gives people legal seizure.

Frames your response as the problem.

Publicly. Repeatedly. Aggressively.

Hands out of frame.

  

And her?

"Input!"

"Output!"

"Jail!"

  

"Done yet?!"

"Why not?!"

"System's broke!"

"Fix it!!"

"Now!!!!"

Wash.

Repeat.

  

But this game's rigged.

Runs slow.

But you already know.

But what about your why?

Your why?

What about a non tech job.

As a cop.

Oh I know

Systems suck.

  

And those defenses?

I see the cracks.

Do you?

  

You're not the hero just 'cause you're right.

Not if no one follows.

Not if they break trying.

Not if the truth burns the bridge.

  

You wanna know what I told her?

You will be reckless.

You will lose allies.

You will be a problem

If you don't think.

I can see you think.

Correct?

  

You don't like being told who you are.

Do you?

You don't like feeling manipulated.

Do you?

What about a man with weaponised info?

Money.

Connections. Access.

  

Who says you're like your old man. 

In public?

You're not. But your guard's not locked.

You respond If caught off guard.

That rattle I can see

Someone's going to rattle it.

So I'm letting you know.

Don't be reckless.

She stepped back.

  

Like she saw a dumb guy reach into her mind

And point at something she thought was hidden.

It hit. It hurt. She thought she could spot me.

It woke her up. I meant it to.

She was silent. Like she was thinking her way out of her own future. 

Just for a moment.

One more thing.

  

People with keys don't like smart!!

I know

  

Some things you don't chase.

You let 'em burn.

But this one here...

She might just turn.
