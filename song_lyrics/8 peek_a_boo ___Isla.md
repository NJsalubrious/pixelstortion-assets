## Song Description

Ethel and Isla. Not sisters in blood but in arms.  
  
They met in what Isla calls “the crazy house" and what a crazy introduction it was. Isla at her most manic and volatile. She could go from zero to a hundred and back again in a flash. She sounds unhinged. Survival mode brought to the edge.  
  
In this moment Ethel and Isla look like two opposites circling the same insane world of Dominic Ryker (Ethels Father). It starts as a taunt and ends like a mirror. One reads as chaos, the other as control, neither certain which role belongs to whom.  
  
Isla is a complex character and there is much more beneath the surface. Much more than her defenses and mental heath struggles initial convey.  
  
Peek-A-Boo catches that first spark between them. Rivalry, recognition, and a charge that would shadow them both and tie them together, in one form or another, from here on out.  

## Lyrics

Peek-a-boo, inbox crack.

Socials open, almost mine.

But she notes me fast.

Mirror trace.

Door knock.

  

Jagged laugh.

New girl in the crazy house.

His blood.

The daughter.

  

Me, step-trash.

Not his mess.

What’s her score?

  

Big bike.

Gifted trap.

Let me split her.

  

At my door.

Time to shine.

  

Hey you, let’s drink.

She doesn’t.

Red hair, flat stare.

Direct, sharp.

  

Let’s fight.

Not fists.

Splinter ride.

  

My dream?

Her on the bike.

Me steering.

But she drives.

Always her hands.

CBD, ten at night.

North Sydney lights.

  

I don’t like this.

Not at all.

  

Intersection red.

Key yanked.

Pocketed.

I’m off.

  

Side street.

Stairs down, fast.

She’ll think train.

Up the other side, 

  

She’s there.

Waiting.

Bumps me.

Wallet gone.

Phone gone.

  

Thief!

She stole my shit!

Bar crowd stirs.

Nightlife trips her.

She falls hard.

Doesn’t rise.

Sirens coming.

Then she stands.

I stand.

We just stand.

I spit it:

She’s my sister.

She calls me crazy.

I look it.

  

She’s kinda cool.

Fuck her.
