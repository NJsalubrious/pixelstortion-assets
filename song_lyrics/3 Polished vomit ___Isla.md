## Song Description

But the world was not all red dirt and clear water.  
  
At the exact same time Ethel was testing perspectives in the outback, a different world was cementing itself in Sydney. This was a world of glass and "calm insanity".  
  
This was Dominic's world.  
  
“Polished Vomit” is Isla at a wedding she shouldn’t have attended, or couldn’t avoid. It's the wedding of Isla's mother and Dominic.  
  
Why is it called "Polished Vomit"? Because that is what she calls her mother. Beautiful on the outside, but inside her mother is a mess dressed up to look like cultured stability.  
  
This is manic Isla. But, even at her most unstable, her mind works like a cipher. Intuitive, creative, unnervingly insightful.  
  
Isla is also really good with locks. Like magician level good but in the real world and not just with physical locks. Passwords as well.  
  
  

## Lyrics

Dominic reads his kind.

Not me.

Mum’s his mirror.

Napkin smile.

Polished vomit.

  

I shine mine too.

Polished vomit.

Vomit polished.

Table placements.

Wine pours.

My ink covered.

Back row with the grey hairs.

  

Eat neat.

Or it ends on your lap.

Mask the meat!

  

Wedding cake wheeled out.

USB slipped in his shoe.

One guard blinked , 

Enough.

  

Cookies cracked.

Inside ,  passwords.

Not random.

Yours.

Your partner’s.

Hidden accounts.

  

Cheating’s easy to hack.

Easy to taste.

Sweet at first bite.

Bitter when it’s read aloud.

  

Projector wars.

Photos flash.

Same boat.

Same men.

Then a politician pants down.

Same deck.

  

Not my problem.

Maybe your wife’s.

  

Someone lunges.

I scream first.

Felt right.

  

His mask sweats.

Room stares.

I eat my cookie slow.

  

Rehab after.

DBT rooms.

He sent me there.

See Mum at least had guilt.

  

He still wants the vomit polished.

Errr.

Vomit blaaaa.
