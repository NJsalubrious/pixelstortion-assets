## Song Description

"Ride" was what Ethel did when she was seventeen, across red dirt on a bike built for escape.  
Raised by her grandparents in rural Australia, she was already learning to weigh harm and walk her own line.  
  
When others slipped into easy crime and tribal excuses, she stepped back quietly. The system called her “withdrawn,” “non-compliant,” “hostile.” No one saw the choice beneath it, the invisible line she refused to cross.  
  
When she logged into her teacher’s computer and uncovered proof of his fraud, the reaction was predictable. He kept his job. She got expelled.  
  
That’s where it all began.

## Lyrics

Pulled the visor down on a sky like tin

Didn't check the map

Didn't ask the question

I know the trail that cuts behind the noise

  

They were laughing in the gravel lot

Boots too loose all smirk and spit

Someone tossed a stolen tin 

I stepped aside That wasn't it

I don't need their brand of bold

Doesn't mean I leave it cold

I just see the mirror behind the stunt

And who cops the hit when the fun runs blunt

  

I watch for the part that gets left out

The wallet that doesn't make it home

The kid that wakes up blamed

And they say it's just a joke

  

Just a laugh

Just one of those things

I call that a pattern

But I don't name it twice

  

I ride the edge but I don't drift blind

The hill tells me when to lean

My brain skips steps you never knew were there

Not guessing Just already seen

You think I'm wild 'cause I don't explain

  

That's fine

I've got gears for that

  

They thought I guessed the answer once

Didn't see the five steps in between

I read the frame before it sets 

And still get marked for broken screens

I opened a file with the wrong name once

Lit up a lie in quiet code

They told me "danger" I said "look closer"

Then they called it luck

Or something owed

  

Gran said

"You don't need to explain what you know

Just know it better than they can fake it"

Pop fixed tools he didn't own

Said

"Things still break Fix them anyway"

  

The ride back yelled with silence 

The trail too straight

The air too slow

Blue lights

No echo from the house

Just shapes

Just boots

Their mouths were moving

But all I heard

Was my name

Mispronounced

  

I don't run fast I run true

The path moves when I need it to

You think I'm chaos

I think you don't listen

I track the cost by what's missing

And what never makes it home

  

I never took the shortcut

I just knew where the road was hiding
