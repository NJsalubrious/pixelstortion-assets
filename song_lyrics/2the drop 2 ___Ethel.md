## Song Description

Geometry, she knew, never changes. But perspectives do. Like people with shaped lenses. And that, more than the fall itself, was what Ethel was testing.  
  
She stood at the lip, moss soft under her toes. She wasn't guessing. Ethel was accessing the parallax, the perspective that twisted the view from below. She saw the "direct line" they couldn't.  
  
She launched.  
  
The fall was pure physics, her arms aligned with the pull, her legs riding the line. The basin tilted up to meet her. The impact was a forceful clap that echoed of the falls rocks, then turquoise silence as Ethel watched a crayfish tail flick through the caustic blue. She rose. Surface break. New breath.  
  
Back on the stone, she passed behind them. They were still on the shelf, staring at their screens, but their posture had changed. The easy bravado was gone, replaced by a "gait shifted," heavy unease.  
  
This was the real test of perspective. They had the image of the dive, but now they were colliding with the reality of the person who did it.

## Lyrics

Looks are deceiving

From here?

Direct line

Deep water

Unlikely to miss

  

I won't

  

From down there?

Parallax

Perspective

Edges jagged

Dive looks impossible

Basin formed from cliffs

Green canopy desert dust drift

  

They've taken the shelf

spread out facing the drop

Phones up

Light glints glass set to catch the distance

  

Moss soft under my toes

Heel just off the lip

Hip turned in

Here we go

  

Launch

  

Fall

  

Air takes over

Arms align with the drop's pull

Legs ride the fall's line

The basin tilts up

  

Impact

water wraps shut

Pressure locks the ribs

Light caustics scatter turquoise

  

Bottom clear enough to see

A tail fly past

Eggs tucked under

crays tail-flicks fast

  

Slow turn

Kick

Rise

  

Surface break

New breath

  

My spot

That lone pixel dot

Found from above

The Drop

  

They're still on the shelf

Phones steady

Walking apart heavy

Gait shifted

  

One looks stops lets it go

Another stays fixed on the screen

Eyes rise short laugh

Cuts it

  

Stone underfoot again

I pass behind

From their shelf no line through

Rock teeth in the drop

Depth squeezes distance

  

It shouldn't work

They'll post it

No bearings

No measure

Just noise

I won't correct them
