## Song Description

“Isla Hates Married Bankers” begins in a late-night burger joint where no one seems to know who the stack of burgers belongs to.  
  
The staff stare, the customers stare, and Isla stares back. In that silence, she takes them and uses the moment to draw in the man who’s been hovering since the club. The married one with family photos on he socials. The one who won’t take no for an answer.  
  
He thinks it’s a game. For Isla, it is. Just not his kind.  
  
Isla, as you my have noticed, is good with locks. All kinds of locks.  
Locking in, locking out, knowing exactly when to switch which.  
  
What looks like chaos is her version of control.  
  
Controlled chaos sitting right on the tipping point.  
  
This song turns a bad night into performance art.  
Part revenge, part comedy, part warning.

## Lyrics

Burgers stacked high.

Eyes on me, not theirs.

Counter staff expect the take.

I take.

They stare.

I grin.

  

Run.

  

He runs.

Hungry.

Wants me.

Thinks I’m cracked.

I am.

So what?

  

This car.

Mine.

Don’t think so?

Tipsy?

No time to think.

Doors slam shut.

  

Wires loose in the dash.

Lights follow us.

Random photos.

That’s my someone.

Pretty lights.

Tunnel screams past.

Average night out.

  

Stop.

He looks.

I look.

Take the wheel.

I’m tipsy, you drive.

  

Pause, voice calm, almost sweet.

Go on.

It’s yours.

  

Doors lock from within.

My trick.

Not yours.

  

Married bankers.

Wrong hands.

Wrong night.

You don’t walk away.
