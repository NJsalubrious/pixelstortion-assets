## Song Description

Ethel had been waiting on a Sydney train platform when a woman nearby reacted to something she saw on a digital billboard in front of them, as if she had seen something meant only for her. Ethel looked closer at the next ad. Similar tone, same design, but a timestamp in the corner did not belong.  
  
"Ants on the Vine" begins there, as Ethel follows what others overlook. Quiet irregularities. Data that's out of place. A name that should not appear where it does.  
  
Kinley.  
  
What she uncovers suggests it is not a one off. It did not need to say anything. Its timing and location were enough to make the point. Access. You're watched. I can do this and more.  
  
But why?

## Lyrics

People write lines

Ants on the vine

Routines grind down black dirt white sign

Names drift quiet one fell through 

Pushed out clean with no follow-through

Public logs

Staff updates slow

But the timeline snapped

When he let go

No breach no threat

But too exact 

Like someone asked

And he stepped back

GitHub thread

README cracked

Three commits

One name stacked

Smart soft-spoken

Typed too flat

To be angry 

Just coded facts

Blog was old

Just plain black

HTML

No SEO

and one mid-line:

Kinley said he'd help

He never said they used me

But you could tell

He knows

  

Self-serve the lie I'll stitch the cost

Fake the fight I'll rig the loss

I don't shift or sway  I level ground

I built this bite from a heavier sound

  

We talked stack trace

Bug fix chat

  

One odd commit 

Push then retract

Then one drop:

Kinley's name

Soft in tone

But tight in tact

  

I already knew

Spun stories early

Filed first

Made questions dirty

  

Accuse to mute

Reframe the scene

Tool of choice?

Distress  routine

  

PI brief was framed around me

Routine coverage

Plausible need

  

Clipboard man 

same shirt twice

Two locations

Watching the read

  

So I rode

Let the PI shoot

I watched Kinley

on his route

Lunch Four Seasons

No disguise

Like he doesn't care

Who buys the lies

  

I followed slow

Paused inside

Concierge took note

Didn't try

Walked out cool

Air felt strange

Didn't see his face 

But the air had changed

  

Self-serve the lie I'll stitch the cost

Fake the fight I'll rig the loss

I don't shift or sway  I level ground

I built this bite from a heavier sound

  

Home fast

Wrong loop

Still lost him

Half a block too loose

Knows the zone now

Narrow field

Map's been drawn

by what I yield

But Clipboard Man?

Didn't go home

Same step count

Same low tone

No folder

but a timed pause sharp

Plastic satchel

Pressed clasp

Then back to the car

Engine soft

Passenger seat

  

Radio off

Private club

Just above the rail

Members only

No paper trail

Not where you'd expect

A public planner

Twice in a week

  

With no event banner

Doesn't make him guilty

But it's not nothing

Just close enough

To feel like something

  

Self-serve the lie I'll stitch the cost

Fake the fight I'll rig the loss

I don't shift or sway  I level ground

I built this bite from a heavier sound
