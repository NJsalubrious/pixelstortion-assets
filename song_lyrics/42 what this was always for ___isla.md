## Song Description

ISLA hits like impact and endurance colliding. It’s the first song she wrote with her new band with a sound built for distortion and defiance, with Isla’s voice cutting clean through the chaos.  
  
The lyrics reclaim what was taken from her. Strength twisted into pain. Silence mistaken for control. She turns both back on themselves. The wall becomes noise. The damage becomes feedback. It’s not just heavy, it’s confrontation made musical. A statement.

## Lyrics

You built this for fists

For split lips

For broken things that don’t scream right

But not for her

Not for the one

Who stopped breathing right, but never died

  

And you called it power

All those nights in the red

But I hear what you buried

You can't hide it from this throat

  

You wrote the wall

I crack the wall

This was always waiting for me

This was never noise

It was pressure with no valve

It was a room without exits

  

You wanted loud

I bring the sound you can't outlive

You kept it hot to cauterize the memory

I breathe it back in

  

Every night

You called it rage

That’s not the word

She had a name

You never learned it

  

You wrote escape

I wear what followed

You can’t mute what this became

You thought she vanished

The girl behind the door

But she learned how to hum in ruin

  

She tuned her scars

This is not your fire now

This is not your edge now

You built the pit

But I climbed it screaming

  

I know what this was always for
