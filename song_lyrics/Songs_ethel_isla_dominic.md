Start ethels story:
[
The world, for Ethel, was three colors. The deep blue of the sky, the impossible red of the desert and the living green of the forest. Home was the border between them all. Home was Gran, who was "fast in all directions," Pop, who was "grounded silence" and Ethel could just be Ethel.  
  
It was a life of unspoken understanding. A "thanks" was never needed for a new bike chain, just as an "I love you" was never needed to feel the "unspoken alliance of minds" she shared with Gran. They just knew .  
  
In her lab, Gran would mutter about "polymer decay" and forget her tea, goggles perched on her head. She wasn't "crazy", she just saw connections from all directions at once. And in that "fast" way of seeing, she saw Ethel perfectly.  
  
Ethel rode the fence line, just because. She wasn't like the "stock kids" with their "big boots, big bikes, bigger land." She wasn't interested in riding gates or fences . She was interested in the "weird pixel on satellite" that shouldn't have been there. The "bend in the earth" she found herself.  
  
It wasn't a cliff, not exactly. It was a twenty meter drop into a basin wrapped in green, a place where one wrong step would mean not landing straight, or at least that is how it looked.  
  
The "stock kids" wanted the moment, the film, the proof. Ethel just wanted to test their perspectives.

## Lyrics

Where the desert meets the forest

Red

Blue

Home

  

Gran left the gate open

She always does

Bike's warm

Pop moved it

Didn't say anything

  

Tyre's rotated

Chain cleaned

I didn't do it

  

No need to say thanks

They know

I know

  

Gran will be in her lab by now

Window open

Goggles on her head

Talking to herself

About polymer decay

And forgetting her tea again

She's not crazy

Just fast in all directions

I ride the fence line straight

They're ahead

Three of them

Stock kids

Big boots Big bikes

Bigger land

  

They ride gates and fences

I ride

Just because

Fifteen K out

Five K in

No tracks marked

Just a weird pixel on satellite

where there shouldn't have been

  

Didn't even look like a fall

But it was

Canopy snaps shut

Track tightens

Ferns stretch over the trail

Air shifts  heavy now

  

One more turn

And we'll see it

I found it last year

Kept it to myself for a while

  

It's not a cliff 

not exactly

It's a bend in the earth

where the stone curves out

drops twenty meters

into a basin wrapped in green

  

Water falls like glass

If the light's right

One wrong step

And you won't land straight

  

But if you do

They're filming

They want the dive

They want the moment

  

I don't say where from

I just stop!

They know what that means

Here we go!
Geometry, she knew, never changes. But perspectives do. Like people with shaped lenses. And that, more than the fall itself, was what Ethel was testing.  
  
She stood at the lip, moss soft under her toes. She wasn't guessing. Ethel was accessing the parallax, the perspective that twisted the view from below. She saw the "direct line" they couldn't.  
  
She launched.  
  
The fall was pure physics, her arms aligned with the pull, her legs riding the line. The basin tilted up to meet her. The impact was a forceful clap that echoed of the falls rocks, then turquoise silence as Ethel watched a crayfish tail flick through the caustic blue. She rose. Surface break. New breath.  
  
Back on the stone, she passed behind them. They were still on the shelf, staring at their screens, but their posture had changed. The easy bravado was gone, replaced by a "gait shifted," heavy unease.  
  
This was the real test of perspective. They had the image of the dive, but now they were colliding with the reality of the person who did it.

## Lyrics

Looks are deceiving

From here?

Direct line

Deep water

Unlikely to miss

  

I won't

  

From down there?

Parallax

Perspective

Edges jagged

Dive looks impossible

Basin formed from cliffs

Green canopy desert dust drift

  

They've taken the shelf

spread out facing the drop

Phones up

Light glints glass set to catch the distance

  

Moss soft under my toes

Heel just off the lip

Hip turned in

Here we go

  

Launch

  

Fall

  

Air takes over

Arms align with the drop's pull

Legs ride the fall's line

The basin tilts up

  

Impact

water wraps shut

Pressure locks the ribs

Light caustics scatter turquoise

  

Bottom clear enough to see

A tail fly past

Eggs tucked under

crays tail-flicks fast

  

Slow turn

Kick

Rise

  

Surface break

New breath

  

My spot

That lone pixel dot

Found from above

The Drop

  

They're still on the shelf

Phones steady

Walking apart heavy

Gait shifted

  

One looks stops lets it go

Another stays fixed on the screen

Eyes rise short laugh

Cuts it

  

Stone underfoot again

I pass behind

From their shelf no line through

Rock teeth in the drop

Depth squeezes distance

  

It shouldn't work

They'll post it

No bearings

No measure

Just noise

I won't correct them



Ethels story song 2
"Ride" was what Ethel did when she was seventeen, across red dirt on a dirt motor bike - fast - bike built for speed and escape.  
Raised by her grandparents in rural Australia, she was already learning to weigh harm and walk her own line.  
  
When others slipped into easy crime and tribal excuses, she stepped back quietly. The system called her “withdrawn,” “non-compliant,” “hostile.” No one saw the choice beneath it, the invisible line she refused to cross.  
  
When she logged into her teacher’s computer and uncovered proof of his fraud, the reaction was predictable. He kept his job. She got expelled.  
  
That’s where it all began.

## Lyrics

Pulled the visor down on a sky like tin

Didn't check the map

Didn't ask the question

I know the trail that cuts behind the noise

  

They were laughing in the gravel lot

Boots too loose all smirk and spit

Someone tossed a stolen tin 

I stepped aside That wasn't it

I don't need their brand of bold

Doesn't mean I leave it cold

I just see the mirror behind the stunt

And who cops the hit when the fun runs blunt

  

I watch for the part that gets left out

The wallet that doesn't make it home

The kid that wakes up blamed

And they say it's just a joke

  

Just a laugh

Just one of those things

I call that a pattern

But I don't name it twice

  

I ride the edge but I don't drift blind

The hill tells me when to lean

My brain skips steps you never knew were there

Not guessing Just already seen

You think I'm wild 'cause I don't explain

  

That's fine

I've got gears for that

  

They thought I guessed the answer once

Didn't see the five steps in between

I read the frame before it sets 

And still get marked for broken screens

I opened a file with the wrong name once

Lit up a lie in quiet code

They told me "danger" I said "look closer"

Then they called it luck

Or something owed

  

Gran said

"You don't need to explain what you know

Just know it better than they can fake it"

Pop fixed tools he didn't own

Said

"Things still break Fix them anyway"

  

The ride back yelled with silence 

The trail too straight

The air too slow

Blue lights

No echo from the house

Just shapes

Just boots

Their mouths were moving

But all I heard

Was my name

Mispronounced

  

I don't run fast I run true

The path moves when I need it to

You think I'm chaos

I think you don't listen

I track the cost by what's missing

And what never makes it home

  

I never took the shortcut

I just knew where the road was hiding

Ethels story song 3 - taking down dominic


Ethel yells the verdict: “You made a cage. FOR YOU!!!!!".  
  
This track holds all the tension of that three year window spent in her estranged fathers world. The gaslight fog. The psychological shell game.  
  
The man who came to kill her one evening....  
  
Silence isn't free and so this track is loud. Its Heavy Metal.

## Lyrics

Quiet isn't peace

Silence isn't free

I know what this is

This is you

Inside my mind

Inside of my mind

Rearranging my mind

  

Words tighten

Wire in my throat

I nod

I kneel

No

My mind would choke

Teeth behind glass

They smile too wide

Guilt pours sweet,

While they break my mind

You chose this

You built this

Liar

  

This isn't care

This isn't kind

This is a cage

Made for my mind

This is the hand

That feeds while it feeds

On me

  

Build a cage

Fell it age

Jail's coming

Hold fear in

Repeat your wins

Until believed

Tough and real

That's why you steal

Can't hurt me

Won't look good

Not in prison

Soap and cooks

  

Big man

Underneath

In between

Covered up

Sealed shut

  

You sell me comfort

While pulling threads

Wrap me quiet

I file anger

To a calm point instead

Breath turns blade

Still, you whisper,

  

You're afraid

I was

But this isn't fear

This is seeing

  

You call it loyalty

You call it blood

But you showed me

What you are

  

This isn't your win

This isn't your spin

This is where

I begin

  

Grind me down

You can't erase me

  

No safety here

No way to mend

What defends

With what lies so bent

Just breath and burn

Just scream and learn

I was blind

I see you turn

  

Build a cage

Build it new

Jail's here

Not for me

Repeat your wins

Nobody hears

Tough and real

Sucks to be you

Can't hurt me

You're locked down

I'm not in prison

We're not the same

Big man

In the dark

Out of reach

Sealed tight

Lost sight

  

I saw it

I see it

You made a cage

  

For you!!



Ethels story song 4
This is an overview sung by ethel outlining the first chapter of her story.  
  
Misread early, Ethel learned the hard way. Systems protect themselves, and people don’t look until someone makes them.  
  
When the loss of her grandparents forces Ethel to live with an estranged father, she sees the same game play out on a larger stage, built on the same rules she already experienced. But she also knows there are ways around that.  
  
Gran left Ethel a point of contact she could trust and Isla did the rest.  
  
Not typical. Not easy.  
  
But Ethel and Isla are neither of these.

## Ethels story Lyrics   story song 3
Didn't top the class, didn't smile on cue

Didn't fit the brochure, still I knew

They read me as slow till numbers said no

North of one five oh, graphs off the window

  

Tick the wrong box and they swap you a tag

Call it a spectrum, then blame you for the drag

  

Gifted

But only if you sit, don't move

I misspelled

Skipped steps

Still proved

  

Didn't play the game

Didn't take the name

Labels on my back

Slid off in the rain

  

Read the system first

Then I changed the frame

  

Clinic tests, double takes, side eyed stance

Aced the placement, they called it chance

  

Cheating, they said, suspension slip

Brief reprieve, then I tightened the grip

  

Grants said one, seats said two

Per student funds don't vanish, they move

Public page worn, slid the admin lane

Reimbursements looped to a single name

  

I logged the route time, screen, path

Took it in hard, no heat, just math

He kept his post, I got expelled

  

So I watched the systems,

Not the world they sell

  

Gran was a chemist, chaos with a license

Dose, endpoint, rinse, precise her science

She saw me straight, no soft translation

Let me move fast, learn by abrasion

  

Dust lifts at the gate

Light bar in the dust

They said both names at the verge

  

I took the track I knew

Five turns,

Then I'm there

Police lights through trees

  

Can't look

(Too real)

  

Seventeen

They said too young

Social services

Boxes assumed

Routine on paper

But the angle turned

  

Father's hand

Off frame

Wrong lean

(Seen)

Court notes

Redacted reason

Each match struck

  

Like a numbered season

I knew

Gran's lab silent

Pop's tools still

The house

Held their will

I don't cry in their way

I set the facts in a row

Can't turn back

Can't slow, shows how far I'll go

I'll give them more than words said nice

  

Airport

Domestic gate

Boarding call

Window left

Strap down

One bag, all I need

  

Everything I am

In a zip and a seam

Runway pull

Lift without drag

  

My choice

I call it choice

Sydney tarmac

Air held wrong

Gate spill

Black car

Motor low and long

Harbor bridge

Steel drawn tight

The metal bone

In executive light

North east pull

Money in moss

The kind that hides

How much it costs

  

His gates

Pierced in glare

Wall of glass, water’s glare

Still it knows my stare

Facade sealed

But the cracks declare

  

Driveway tag

Bike in sight

Gifted test

Engine bite

Visor down

  

Note on the bike

Ride it

He wasn't there

Throttle steady

I take what's given

Not the message

Not the scene

  

My choice

I choose

Make it choice

Night return.

Black glass water glare

Security thick but safety rare

  

Father's partner's kid

Isla there

Perma lit

Voice loud

Eyes glazed

Nothing square

  

Looks crazy

But...

Something...

(More there)

  

Gran left a key like a map in a pocket

Box in a bank, contact on a docket

AFP number, I dialed it once

Information only, no hero stunts

  

Rules

No boasting, no noisy devices

Everything repeatable, chain over vices

Heat rose later, safe address made

Different walls, different shade

  

Face like a window

Talk like a screen

You watch the reflections

But you don't step between

Frame the house

Mark the gate

You ride anyway

No matter the state

  

My father

Dominic

And crew

  

Not met, assessed

Calm like myth

Builds masks for weapons

Smiles with pith

Empire of omissions

Deeds offshore

Redacted paper

Another locked door

Moves like nothing could touch his skin

Mostly

It didn't

I watched defense win

  

Not a princess arc

Not a rescue scene

Just a clean ledger

And gasoline

  

He tried to buy Isla's end with a dealer stack

Money walked first, the visit did the rest

She read his habits, guessed his keys

Same spine on every lock, lazy ease

  

You frame the room

But you ride through still

What they call the story?

Just a line to fill

  

You learn to read

Without reading in

Facade or front

Same door, same spin

And you keep riding

  

No matter the skin

Trial ends, headlines crown what they sell

Daughter dropped king, neat little spell

But it's repetition, rooms with fluorescent

Truth said with a finger, mute ready

I stood when called, held the line

Stillness sharpened into design

  

They call it brave, they call it choice

If that sounds optional, you weren't in that noise

Call the thing what it is

Keep the good names out

The rest?

Write it down

Make it stand

Watch it count

islas song 1
But the world was not all red dirt and clear water.  
  
At the exact same time Ethel was testing perspectives in the outback, a different world was cementing itself in Sydney. This was a world of glass and "calm insanity".  
  
This was Dominic's world.  
  
“Polished Vomit” is Isla at a wedding she shouldn’t have attended, or couldn’t avoid. It's the wedding of Isla's mother and Dominic.  
  
Why is it called "Polished Vomit"? Because that is what she calls her mother. Beautiful on the outside, but inside her mother is a mess dressed up to look like cultured stability.  
  
This is manic Isla. But, even at her most unstable, her mind works like a cipher. Intuitive, creative, unnervingly insightful.  
  
Isla is also really good with locks. Like magician level good but in the real world and not just with physical locks. Passwords as well.  
  
  

## Lyrics

Dominic reads his kind.

Not me.

Mum’s his mirror.

Napkin smile.

Polished vomit.

  

I shine mine too.

Polished vomit.

Vomit polished.

Table placements.

Wine pours.

My ink covered.

Back row with the grey hairs.

  

Eat neat.

Or it ends on your lap.

Mask the meat!

  

Wedding cake wheeled out.

USB slipped in his shoe.

One guard blinked , 

Enough.

  

Cookies cracked.

Inside ,  passwords.

Not random.

Yours.

Your partner’s.

Hidden accounts.

  

Cheating’s easy to hack.

Easy to taste.

Sweet at first bite.

Bitter when it’s read aloud.

  

Projector wars.

Photos flash.

Same boat.

Same men.

Then a politician pants down.

Same deck.

  

Not my problem.

Maybe your wife’s.

  

Someone lunges.

I scream first.

Felt right.

  

His mask sweats.

Room stares.

I eat my cookie slow.

  

Rehab after.

DBT rooms.

He sent me there.

See Mum at least had guilt.

  

He still wants the vomit polished.

Errr.

Vomit blaaaa.
Islas song 2
Islas song : This song marks the night Isla burned Dominc's bridge to freedom. The song is part revenge, part release.  
  
Mara Quinn, Senior Reporter at "The Southern objective" would later write:  
  
"Start with the documents. Their path into court isn’t a heist narrative. It’s procedure.  
  
Sources close to the matter say Isla, derided as “the addict girl” by commentators who haven’t read a brief, first surfaced material that pointed to long running patterns,  
  
Circular payments through shell entities, land assemblies that moved like chess, and external contractors whose invoices tracked neatly with campaign seasons. None of that becomes evidence until law enforcement recreates the trail. That’s what happened. Officers did the slow part. Warrants, images of drives, chain of custody. The songs and the spectacle are a sideshow. The documents are not."

##  islas song - burning dominics bridgeLyrics

He bought me out in needles.

Found my dealer, stacked it high.

Last good time’s on me.

Like it made him noble.

Like my death was proof he cared.

I said thank you.

Like it was dinner.

Like he’d done me a favor.

Five men, front steps, watching glass.

I smiled through it ,  calm, steady.

Then slammed the teeth of the house back shut.

Steel psychos flip.

Shadows left in the dark.

You’ll be alright out there.

Wait a while.

He’ll be back.

No he won’t!

Fists on doors.

Phones useless.

Five tough men small outside.

  

Inside, my hands ran the system.

Every click mine.

Every lock theirs.

Nice to meet you.

Now die in the cold.

  

I walked his rooms.

Drives pulled one by one.

Empire bleeding in my hands.

Black boxes heavy as sins.

  

Funny, really.

He thought overdose was a gift.

But this?

This is mine back.

Exit unseen.

The hole only he and the builder knew.

Now me.

Steps fading.

Breath gone.

  

Bridge burned!

Dominic song1
Song - Structural Psychopathy:
People don't see the cause
They look at reaction
It's easier that way

They track tone
Not the trigger
Outcome
Not the structure underneath

Someone pushes your break line
Then acts shocked when it moves

They call you reactive
But never ask what they did
Before you broke surface

I have seen it everywhere
In every planning room in this city

Someone wants a shortcut
And someone else wants a scapegoat

And I feel it
I feel it happening to you

You were too tired
Exactly where they wanted you

See how they spun it
One outburst
And your history
Becomes the headline

That planner did not want clarity
He wanted control of the narrative
And he got it

Too exhausted
To defend the frame
They built around you

Let me show you the real pattern

They rewrite you when they can't read you
They flag your tone not the contact
They spin your story into their version
Then step back
I watched it land
I tracked it through
I don't let it go
Because intent cuts true

So let's sit
Let's talk

Your hands are trembling
Your emails stack unread
The ceiling of this project
You are holding it alone

And they think you are having a moment
Of course they do
Here you are at midnight
Fixing their mistake

With the soil report contradicting itself
For the third time

I see you arguing
For safer footings
But getting drowned out
By cost consultants
Who have never had sign off
On anything more than an agreement

Let's be practical
One rod is ideal
Rigor is ideal

But the schedule is bleeding out

And rigor does not help
When the bank will not extend the loan
And the panel meets in eight days

When the builder walks out

Projects this size
Live by adjustments
Not ideals

Two rods
Offset the load
Same result
Faster install
Cheaper labour

Eighteen to twenty four months
Back in your pocket

Your life back in your pocket

You can go home
You can sleep

Just say yes
Or don't say anything at all

If you want it to be
It can be

They rewrite you when they can't read you
They flag your tone not the contact
They turn your story into their version
Then step back
I watched it land
I tracked it through
I won't not let it slide
Because intent cuts true

It is over engineered
It is structurally sound
You know it is

You're' exhausted

Let the project breathe
Let yourself breathe

You can go home
You can turn off your phone
Spend time with your kids
Spend time with your wife

That sounds good does it not
Yeah

I'll rewrite your story when they can't read you
I'll set your tone so they will not believe you
I'll shape truths story into my version
Then step back
I'll watched it land
I'll tracked it through
I'll let you be
What I needed you to be

Sydney
Late afternoon
The steel let go

Like a small earthquake
One
Two
Then another
The fourth floor hit the third
The third hit the second
The second hit the floor

The headline is written
Looking at you

It was just you
Just you
Just you
Just you

Just you
Dominics song 2 - you will thank me later

In the cold, structured walls of prison, Dominic finds his next project. His new cellmate. Not with a show of force. Not with threats. But with a calm voice in a room where the loud have already lost.  
  
This is Dominic’s song: A calm, rhythmic guide to turning trust into currency, and a willing man into a spent resource.  
  
Step 1: Remove doubt.  
Step 2: Remove choice without them noticing. Keep your voice even. Match their rhythm.  
  
Step 3: Give them something harmless to do  
Step 4: Give them something important to do  
Step 4: Finally give them something they can’t take back.  
  
Never rush. Never ask twice.  
  
By the time they see the pattern, you’re already holding the ending.

## Lyrics

Not every door is meant to open.

Not every weight is yours to lift.

Is really yours.

  

But that's good.

That's safety.

That's why I'm here.

  

Tired?

Of guessing.

Of watching.

Of wondering.

  

I get that.

Structure helps.

Rules save time.

Obedience clears space.

Why hold burdens

That I already know

How to carry?

  

Just...

Follow clean.

You'll see.

  

You will rest.

(You will.)

  

You will see.

(You will.)

  

You will let go.

(You will.)

  

You will need me.

(You will.)

  

Anger burns fast.

Noise burns faster.

Plans?

They cloud.

  

But rhythm?

That's power.

  

I don't shout.

I don't clash.

  

I hold steady.

While others thin out.

  

Stay near.

Stay easy.

  

I build.

You borrow.

  

That's how you win.

That's how I win.

  

Look around.

See them rush?

See them grasp?

  

Soon they'll ask me.

Not because they lost.

Because they want to stop losing.

  

Smart, really.

Better to lean

than be left.

  

You will rest.

(You will.)

  

You will see.

(You will.)

  

You will let go.

(You will.)

  

You will need me.

(You will.)

  

No need to run.

No need to reach.

No need to doubt.

  

You already decided.

You already asked.

You just didn't

know it.

  

But that's why

you'll thank me later.
